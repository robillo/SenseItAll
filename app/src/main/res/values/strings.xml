        <item>Proximity sensing technology is becoming popular across a wide range of industries, especially in consumer electronics, because OEMs introduce new products to market every year. The largest application within consumer electronics is the mobile phone.\n\n

            Given the competition in this particular market, it is important for OEMs to adopt the latest technology and offer unique features to differentiate their products.\n\n

Today, mobile phones use IR-based proximity sensors to detect the presence of a human ear. This sensing is done for two purposes: Reduce display power consumption by turning off the LCD backlight and to disable the touch screen to avoid inadvertent touches by the cheek.\n\n

            IR sensors have a number of disadvantages, including high power consumption, high cost, blind zones, and accumulation of dirt, as well as unreliable performance over temperature, hair, and skin color variations. Recent advances in capacitive proximity sensing technology address these designs disadvantages and could potentially replace every IR sensor in the mobile phone market.\n\n

        <item>Mobile phones use IR-based proximity sensors to detect the presence of a human ear. This sensing is done for two purposes: Reduce display power consumption by turning off the LCD backlight and to disable the touch screen to avoid inadvertent touches by the cheek. IR sensors have a number of disadvantages, including high power consumption, high cost, blind zones, and accumulation of dirt, as well as unreliable performance over temperature, hair, and skin color variations.\n\n

        Capacitive proximity sensing has enabled several features in mobile phones. While these features may not be evident to end users, they provide many important capabilities, including optimized power consumption, integrated functionality, and cost reduction. It is essential that product designers understand the different features that can be implemented through capacitive proximity sensing.\n\n
        </item>
        <item>Face detection has existed in mobile phones (both smartphones and feature phones) for over a decade. Face detection prevents false touches when the phone is close to the ear and reduces power consumption by dimming/shutting off the display. Mobile phones are battery-operated, which is the most useful and frequently implemented feature. \n\n
        This feature is commonly implemented in tablets, but it can also be applicable to mobiles in certain cases. Specific absorption rate (SAR) is a measure of the rate at which energy is absorbed by the human body when exposed to a radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic field.\n\n

            The FCC (Federal Communications Commission) requires devices to limit the absorption of RF energy by reducing the RF transmit power of the tablet when in close proximity to the human body.\n\n</item>
        <item>This feature makes the user interface (i.e., buttons/touchscreen) visible on a proximity detect event.\n\n
            This enables the device to operate in a low power, standby state when not in use and then wake-up into an active state when a user’s hand approaches. This helps reduce system wake-up time, improve device responsiveness and overall design aesthetics, and optimize average power consumption.\n\n
</item>
        <item>Capacitive proximity sensors are based on the same principle as self capacitance-based capacitive touch sensing.\n\n

Here, the sensor is a conductive pad or a loop laid on a non-conductive substrate. This conductive pad has a self capacitance Cp. When another conductive material (i.e., a human face in this application) comes close to the conductive pad, the capacitance of the sensor increases (by an amount = Cf). A microcontroller continuously measures the capacitance of the sensor(s) and looks for a sudden jump in capacitance to determine the presence of a conductive object near the sensor.\n\n

Proximity sensors are designed to maximize the ratio Cf/Cp for a given sensor to be able to reliably detect proximity.
A capacitive proximity sensor-based implementation for face detection involves the following aspects:\n\n

Sensor placement.\n
Sensor design.\n
Sensor material and stack-up.\n
Firmware techniques for enhanced proximity.\n
Firmware techniques for use case handling.\n\n</item>

    <string-array name="accelerometer_descriptions">
        <item>An accelerometer is a sensor which measures the tilting motion and orientation of a mobile phone.\n\n

The Apple iPhone was the first popular mobile phone to make the accelerometer a key feature of its user interface.\n\n

The accelerometer is used to ensure photographs are presented in the correct way - portrait or landscape - depending on the way the phone is held.\n\n

Accelerometers are also increasingly used as a means of user input, most noticeably in games where tilting and rotating the handset can control onscreen action.\n\n</item>
        <item>The application of accelerometers extends to multiple disciplines, both academic and consumer-driven. For example, accelerometers in laptops protect hard drives from damage. If the laptop were to suddenly drop while in use, the accelerometer would detect the sudden free fall and immediately turn off the hard drive to avoid hitting the reading heads into the hard drive platter.\n\n

            Without this, the two would strike and cause scratches to the platter for extensive file and reading damage. Accelerometers are likewise used in cars as the industry method way of detecting car crashes and deploying airbags almost instantaneously.\n\n

In another example, a dynamic accelerometer measures gravitational pull to determine the angle at which a device is tilted with respect to the Earth. By sensing the amount of acceleration, users analyze how the device is moving.\n\n

Accelerometers allow the user to understand the surroundings of an item better. With this small device, you can determine if an object is moving uphill, whether it will fall over if it tilts any more, or whether it’s flying horizontally or angling downward. For example, smartphones rotate their display between portrait and landscape mode depending on how you tilt the phone.\n\n</item>
        <item>It changes/adjusts the screen to proper viewing, when user changes the orientation from horizontal/landscape to vertical/portrait and vice-versa.\n\n

It interacts or controls the racing games (motion sensitive) by changing the direction or steer of the racing vehicle.\n\n

It helps the user to mute the phone/device in case of incoming call or when music is played, just by turning the device facing downward.\n\n

It makes web-browsing and photo viewing better by changing the orientation.\n\n

Accelerometer is also used in many devices like laptop for detecting drops. Whenever any drop is detected, it signals the hard disk\'s heads and they are parked or stopped to avoid the data losses. Hence for data security, accelerometer plays an important role.\n\n</item>
        <item>An accelerator looks like a simple circuit for some larger electronic device. Despite its humble appearance, the accelerometer consists of many different parts and works in many ways, two of which are the piezoelectric effect and the capacitance sensor.\n\n

            The piezoelectric effect is the most common form of accelerometer and uses microscopic crystal structures that become stressed due to accelerative forces. These crystals create a voltage from the stress, and the accelerometer interprets the voltage to determine velocity and orientation.\n\n

The capacitance accelerometer senses changes in capacitance between microstructures located next to the device. If an accelerative force moves one of these structures, the capacitance will change and the accelerometer will translate that capacitance to voltage for interpretation.\n\n

Accelerometers are made up of many different components, and can be purchased as a separate device. Analog and digital displays are available, though for most technology devices, these components are integrated into the main technology and accessed using the governing software or operating system.\n\n</item>

    <string-array name="light_descriptions">
        <item>An ambient light sensor is a component in mobile devices, notebooks, automotive displays and LCD TVs.\n\n
            It is used to sense the amount of light in a room, and appropriately dim the screen to match it. The international unit of ambient light is luminance (lux).\n\n
        </item>
        <item>The pupils of your eye dilate when the light entering it is dimmed.\n\n
            Just like electronic devices, if the brightness is too bright, our eyes will respond appropriately.\n\n
            In a smart-phone an ambient light sensor can be used for brightness adjustment, which saves energy and can also prolong the lifetime of the battery.\n\n</item>
        <item>The current technology of ambient light sensors is equivalent to the light sensitivity of human beings.\n\n
            Ambient light sensors are able to divide into three fields; photo transistor, photo diode and the optical IC which is integrated with the amplifier.\n\n</item>
        <item>If a TV has a built-in ambient light sensor, it will adjust the brightness of TV making it clearer and more brilliant, and improving the good picture quality.\n\n
            An ambient light sensor works like human eyes, to identify the ambient light and control the light source of display accordingly.\n\n
While using a smart phone in the day or bright light, if the light is detected by ambient light sensor to be higher, the back-light of smart phone will decrease in brightness.\n\n
            Conversely, the back-light will be stronger while using the smart phone at night..\n\n
            The power consumption of the back-light effects the battery endurance. The power consumption of a smart phone is around 300 mW ~ 400 mW.\n\n
            If the screen of a smart phone displays for long time, the power consumption is higher so the battery endurance will be reduced. Smart-phones with built-in ambient light sensors are able to reduce this issue.\n\n</item>

    <string-array name="camera_descriptions">
        <item>Most camera phones are simpler than separate digital cameras. Their usual fixed-focus lenses and smaller sensors limit their performance in poor lighting.\n\n

            Lacking a physical shutter, some have a long shutter lag. Photo-flash is typically provided by an LED source which illuminates less intensely over a much longer exposure time than a bright and near-instantaneous flash strobe.\n\n

            Optical zoom and tripod screws are rare and none has a hot shoe for attaching an external flash. Some also lack a USB connection or a removable memory card. Most have Bluetooth and WiFi, and can make geo-tagged photographs.\n\n

            Some of the more expensive camera phones have only a few of these technical disadvantages, but with bigger image sensors (a few are up to 1), their capabilities approach those of low-end point-and-shoot cameras.\n\n

            In the smartphone era, the steady sales increase of camera phones caused point-and-shoot camera sales to peak about 2010 and decline thereafter. Most model lines improve their cameras every year or two.\n\n

Most modern smartphones only have a menu choice to start a camera application program and an on-screen button to activate the shutter. Some also have a separate camera button, for quickness and convenience. A few camera phones are designed to resemble separate low-end digital compact cameras in appearance and to some degree in features and picture quality, and are branded as both mobile phones and cameras.\n\n

The principal advantages of camera phones are cost and compactness; indeed for a user who carries a mobile phone anyway, the addition is negligible.\n\n

            Smartphones that are camera phones may run mobile applications to add capabilities such as geotagging and image stitching. Also, smartphones can use their touch screens to direct their camera to focus on a particular object in the field of view, giving even an inexperienced user a degree of focus control exceeded only by seasoned photographers using manual focus.\n\n

            However, the touch screen, being a general purpose control, lacks the agility of a separate camera\'s dedicated buttons and dial(s).\n\n</item>
        <item>Nearly all camera phones use CMOS image sensors, due to largely reduced power consumption compared to CCD type cameras, which are also used, but in few camera phones. Some of camera phones even use more expensive Backside Illuminated CMOS which uses energy lesser than CMOS, although more expensive than CMOS and CCD.\n\n

        As camera phone technology has progressed over the years, the lens design has evolved from a simple double Gauss or Cooke triplet to many molded plastic aspheric lens elements made with varying dispersion and refractive indexes. The latest generation of phone cameras also apply distortion (optics), vignetting, and various optical aberration corrections to the image before it is compressed into a .jpeg format.\n\n

        Most camera phones have a digital zoom feature. A few have optical zoom. An external camera can be added, coupled wirelessly to the phone by Wi-Fi. They are compatible with most smartphones.\n\n</item>
        <item>Images are usually saved in the JPEG file format, except for some high-end camera phones which have also RAW feature and the Android 5.0 Lollipop has facility of it. Windows Phones can be configured to operate as a camera even if the phone is asleep. An external flash can be employed, to improve performance.\n\n

Phones usually store pictures and video in a directory called /DCIM in the internal memory. Some can store this media in external memory (Secure digital card or USB on the go pen drive).\n\n</item>
        <item>Camera phones can share pictures almost instantly and automatically via a sharing infrastructure integrated with the carrier network. Early developers including Philippe Kahn envisioned a technology that would enable service providers to \"collect a fee every time anyone snaps a photo\".\n\n

            The resulting technologies, Multimedia Messaging Service and Sha-Mail, were developed parallel to and in competition to open Internet-based mobile communication provided by GPRS and later 3G networks.\n\n

The first commercial camera phone complete with infrastructure was the J-SH04, made by Sharp Corporation; it had an integrated CCD sensor, with the Sha-Mail (Picture-Mail in Japanese) infrastructure developed in collaboration with Kahn\'s LightSurf venture, and marketed from 2001 by J-Phone in Japan today owned by Softbank.\n\n

            The first commercial deployment in North America of camera phones was in 2004. The Sprint wireless carriers deployed over one million camera phone manufactured by Sanyo and launched by the PictureMail infrastructure (Sha-Mail in English) developed and managed by LightSurf.\n\n

While early phones had Internet connectivity, working web browsers and email-programs, the phone menu offered no way of including a photo in an email or uploading it to a web site.\n\n

            Connecting cables or removable media that would enable the local transfer of pictures were also usually missing. Modern smartphones have almost unlimited connectivity and transfer options with photograph attachment features.\n\n</item>

    <string-array name="gps_descriptions">
        <item>The Global Positioning System (GPS), originally Navstar GPS, is a satellite-based radionavigation system owned by the United States government and operated by the United States Air Force.\n\n

            It is a global navigation satellite system that provides geolocation and time information to a GPS receiver anywhere on or near the Earth where there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites.Obstacles such as mountains and buildings block the relatively weak GPS signals.\n\n

The GPS does not require the user to transmit any data, and it operates independently of any telephonic or internet reception, though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the GPS positioning information.\n\n

            The GPS provides critical positioning capabilities to military, civil, and commercial users around the world. The United States government created the system, maintains it, and makes it freely accessible to anyone with a GPS receiver.\n\n</item>
        <item>The GPS project was launched in the United States in 1973 to overcome the limitations of previous navigation systems, integrating ideas from several predecessors, including a number of classified engineering design studies from the 1960s. The U.S. Department of Defense developed the system, which originally used 24 satellites.\n\n

            It was initially developed for use by the United States military and became fully operational in 1995. Civilian use was allowed from the 1980s. Roger L. Easton of the Naval Research Laboratory, Ivan A. Getting of The Aerospace Corporation, and Bradford Parkinson of the Applied Physics Laboratory are credited with inventing it.\n\n

The design of GPS is based partly on similar ground-based radio-navigation systems, such as LORAN and the Decca Navigator, developed in the early 1940s.\n\n</item>
        <item>The GPS concept is based on time and the known position of GPS specialized satellites. The satellites carry very stable atomic clocks that are synchronized with one another and with the ground clocks.\n\n

            Any drift from true time maintained on the ground is corrected daily. In the same manner, the satellite locations are known with great precision. GPS receivers have clocks as well, but they are less stable and less precise.\n\n

GPS satellites continuously transmit data about their current time and position. A GPS receiver monitors multiple satellites and solves equations to determine the precise position of the receiver and its deviation from true time.\n\n

            At a minimum, four satellites must be in view of the receiver for it to compute four unknown quantities (three position coordinates and clock deviation from satellite time).\n\n</item>
        <item>The current GPS consists of three major segments. These are the space segment, a control segment, and a user segment. The U.S. Air Force develops, maintains, and operates the space and control segments.\n\n

            GPS satellites broadcast signals from space, and each GPS receiver uses these signals to calculate its three-dimensional location (latitude, longitude, and altitude) and the current time\n\n

        The space segment (SS) is composed of 24 to 32 satellites in medium Earth orbit and also includes the payload adapters to the boosters required to launch them into orbit.\n\n

        The control segment (CS) is composed of:\n\n

    <string-array name="flash_descriptions">
        <item>A flash is a device used in photography producing a flash of artificial light (typically 1/1000 to 1/200 of a second) at a color temperature of about 5500 K to help illuminate a scene.\n\n

            A major purpose of a flash is to illuminate a dark scene. Other uses are capturing quickly moving objects or changing the quality of light.\n\n

            Flash refers either to the flash of light itself or to the electronic flash unit discharging the light. Most current flash units are electronic, having evolved from single-use flashbulbs and flammable powders. Modern cameras often activate flash units automatically.\n\n

Flash units are commonly built directly into a camera. Some cameras allow separate flash units to be mounted via a standardized \"accessory mount\" bracket (a hot shoe). In professional studio equipment, flashes may be large, standalone units, or studio strobes, powered by special battery packs or connected to mains power.\n\n

            They are either synchronized with the camera using a flash synchronization cable or radio signal, or are light-triggered, meaning that only one flash unit needs to be synchronized with the camera, and in turn triggers the other units, called slaves.\n\n</item>
        <item>Using on-camera flash will give a very harsh light, which results in a loss of shadows in the image, because the only lightsource is in practically the same place as the camera.\n\n

            Balancing the flash power and ambient lighting or using off-camera flash can help overcome these issues. Using an umbrella or softbox (the flash will have to be off-camera for this) makes softer shadows.\n\n

A typical problem with cameras using built-in flash units is the low intensity of the flash; the level of light produced will often not suffice for good pictures at distances of over 3 metres (10 ft) or so.\n\n

            Dark, murky pictures with excessive image noise or \"grain\" will result. In order to get good flash pictures with simple cameras, it is important not to exceed the recommended distance for flash pictures.\n\n

            Larger flashes, especially studio units and monoblocks, have sufficient power for larger distances, even through an umbrella, and can even be used against sunlight at short distances.\n\n

Cameras which automatically flash in low light conditions often do not take into account the distance to the subject, causing them to fire even when the subject is several tens of metres away and unaffected by the flash.\n\n

            In crowds at sports matches, concerts and so on, the stands or the auditorium can be a constant sea of flashes, resulting in distraction to the performers or players and providing absolutely no benefit to the \'photographers\'.\n\n

The \"red-eye effect\" is another problem with on camera and ring flash units. Since the retina of the human eye reflects red light straight back in the direction it came from, pictures taken from straight in front of a face often exhibit this effect.\n\n

            It can be somewhat reduced by using the \"red eye reduction\" found on many cameras (a pre-flash that makes the subject\'s irises contract). However, very good results can be obtained only with a flash unit that is separated from the camera, sufficiently far from the optical axis, or by using bounce flash, where the flash head is angled to bounce light off a wall, ceiling or reflector.\n\n</item>
        <item>Flash duration is commonly described by two numbers that are expressed in fractions of a second:\n\n

t.1 is the length of time the light intensity is above 0.1 (10%) of the peak intensity\n
t.5 is the length of time the light intensity is above 0.5 (50%) of the peak intensity\n\n

For example, a single flash event might have a t.5 value of 1/1200 and t.1 of 1/450. These values determine the ability of a flash to \"freeze\" moving subjects in applications such as sports photography.\n\n

In cases where intensity is controlled by capacitor discharge time, t.5 and t.1 decrease with decreasing intensity. Conversely, in cases where intensity is controlled by capacitor charge, t.5 and t.1 increase with decreasing intensity due to the non-linearity of the capacitor\'s discharge curve.\n\n</item>
        <item>High-current flash LEDs are used as flash sources in camera phones, although they are not yet at the power levels to equal xenon flash devices (that are rarely used in phones) in still cameras.\n\n

            The major advantages of LEDs over xenon include low voltage operation, higher efficiency, and extreme miniaturization. The LED flash can also be used for illumination of video recordings or as an autofocus assist lamp in low-light conditions.\n\n</item>

    <string-array name="multi_touch_descriptions">
        <item>In computing, multi-touch is technology that enables a surface (a trackpad or touchscreen) to recognize the presence of more than one or more than two points of contact with the surface.\n\n

            The origins of multitouch began at CERN, MIT, University of Toronto, Carnegie Mellon University and Bell Labs in the 1970s. Multi-touch was in use as early as 1985. Apple popularized the term \"multi-touch\" in 2007. Plural-point awareness may be used to implement additional functionality, such as pinch to zoom or to activate certain subroutines attached to predefined gestures.\n\n

The two different uses of the term resulted from the quick developments in this field, and many companies using the term to market older technology which is called gesture-enhanced single-touch or several other terms by other companies and researchers.\n\n

            Several other similar or related terms attempt to differentiate between whether a device can exactly determine or only approximate the location of different points of contact to further differentiate between the various technological capabilities, but they are often used as synonyms in marketing.\n\n</item>

        <item>Apple has retailed and distributed numerous products using multi-touch technology, most prominently including its iPhone smartphone and iPad tablet.\n\n

            Additionally, Apple also holds several patents related to the implementation of multi-touch in user interfaces, however the legitimacy of some patents has been disputed. Apple additionally attempted to register \"Multi-touch\" as a trademark in the United States—however its request was denied by the United States Patent and Trademark Office because it considered the term generic.\n\n

Multi-touch sensing and processing occurs via an ASIC sensor that is attached to the touch surface. Usually, separate companies make the ASIC and screen that combine into a touch screen; conversely, a trackpad\'s surface and ASIC are usually manufactured by the same company.\n\n

            There have been large companies in recent years that have expanded into the growing multi-touch industry, with systems designed for everything from the casual user to multinational organizations.\n\n

It is now common for laptop manufacturers to include multi-touch trackpads on their laptops, and tablet computers respond to touch input rather than traditional stylus input and it is supported by many recent operating systems.\n\n</item>
        <item>Multi-touch has been implemented in several different ways, depending on the size and type of interface. The most popular form are mobile devices, tablets, touchtables and walls. Both touchtables and touch walls project an image through acrylic or glass, and then back-light the image with LEDs.\n\n

Touch surfaces can also be made pressure-sensitive by the addition of a pressure-sensitive coating that flexes differently depending on how firmly it is pressed, altering the reflection.\n\n

Handheld technologies use a panel that carries an electrical charge. When a finger touches the screen, the touch disrupts the panel\'s electrical field. The disruption is registered as a computer event (gesture) and may be sent to the software, which may then initiates a response to the gesture event.\n\n

In the past few years, several companies have released products that use multi-touch. In an attempt to make the expensive technology more accessible, hobbyists have also published methods of constructing DIY touchscreens.\n\n</item>

    <string-array name="fingerprint_descriptions">
        <item>A fingerprint in its narrow sense is an impression left by the friction ridges of a human finger. The recovery of fingerprints from a crime scene is an important method of forensic science.\n\n

            Fingerprints are easily deposited on suitable surfaces (such as glass or metal or polished stone) by the natural secretions of sweat from the eccrine glands that are present in epidermal ridges. These are sometimes referred to as \"Chanced Impressions\".\n\n

In a wider use of the term, fingerprints are the traces of an impression from the friction ridges of any part of a human or other primate hand. A print from the sole of the foot can also leave an impression of friction ridges.\n\n

Deliberate impressions of fingerprints may be formed by ink or other substances transferred from the peaks of friction ridges on the skin to a relatively smooth surface such as a fingerprint card.\n\n

            Fingerprint records normally contain impressions from the pad on the last joint of fingers and thumbs, although fingerprint cards also typically record portions of lower joint areas of the fingers.\n\n</item>
        <item>Fingerprint authentication refers to the automated method of verifying a match between two human fingerprints. Fingerprints are one of many forms of biometrics used to identify individuals and verify their identity.\n\n

The analysis of fingerprints for matching purposes generally requires the comparison of several features of the print pattern. These include patterns, which are aggregate characteristics of ridges, and minutia points, which are unique features found within the patterns.\n\n

            It is also necessary to know the structure and properties of human skin in order to successfully employ some of the imaging technologies.\n\n

The three basic patterns of fingerprint ridges are the arch, loop, and whorl:\n\n

arch: The ridges enter from one side of the finger, rise in the center forming an arc, and then exit the other side of the finger.\n
loop: The ridges enter from one side of a finger, form a curve, and then exit on that same side.\n
whorl: Ridges form circularly around a central point on the finger.\n\n
Scientists have found that family members often share the same general fingerprint patterns, leading to the belief that these patterns are inherited.\n\n</item>
        <item>Fingerprint processing has three primary functions: enrollment, searching and verification. Among these functions, enrollment which captures fingerprint image from the sensor plays an important role.\n\n

            A reason is that the way people put their fingerprints on a mirror to scan can affect to the result in the searching and verifying process.\n\n

            Regarding to verification function, there are several techniques to match fingerprints such as correlation-based matching, minutiae-based matching, ridge feature-based matching and minutiae-based algorithm.\n\n

            However, the most popular algorithm was minutiae based matching algorithm due to its efficiency and accuracy.\n\n</item>
        <item>Two of the first smartphone manufacturers to integrate fingerprint recognition into their phones were Motorola with the Atrix 4G in 2011, and Apple with the iPhone 5S on 10 September 2013.\n\n

            One month after, HTC launched the One Max, which also included fingerprint recognition. In April 2014, Samsung released the Galaxy S5, which integrated a fingerprint sensor on the home button.\n\n

Since December 2015, cheaper smartphones with fingerprint recognition have been released, such as the $100 UMI Fair. Samsung also recently introduced fingerprint sensors to its mid-range A-series smartphones.\n\n

On 25 September 2015 with iPhone 6s, two years after introduction of its first fingerprint scanner in the iPhone 5S, Apple introduced a new generation fingerprint scanner claiming faster response times. In August 2016, OPPO claimed 0,22s response time in its Oppo F1\'s model.\n\n

Hewlett Packard, Asus, Huawei, Lenovo and Apple are using fingerprint reader in their laptops. Synaptics says the SecurePad sensor is now available for OEMs to start building into their laptops.\n\n</item>

    <string-array name="screen_descriptions">
        <item>Mobile phones have progressed dramatically since the days their displays needed only to show you the number of the person calling. Once we added text messaging and even email, we need a bit more space to see what we\'d written.\n\n

We added colour to give them a bit more interest. When we started adding cameras to the phones, we wanted the screens to be sharper, so we could see the terrible, pixelated VGA photos we\'d taken.\n\n

Once the ability to store video arrived, we needed them to be smooth, with good refresh rates.\n\n

In the era of touchscreen smartphones, we expect them to be as good as computer screens, offering crisp text, vibrant images, blur-free video and enough brightness to see outdoors, all under a responsive touch layer.\n\n

Predictably, several different options have arisen, especially when it comes to high-end smartphones. As a result, it can be hard to know exactly what manufacturers (and, indeed, technology sites) are talking about when they boast about Super AMOLED screens or Retina displays.\n\n

So what\'s the best phone screen to go for? We\'ve rounded up all the important information about different mobile screen types below, so you\'ll know what to look out for on your next phone.\n\n</item>
        <item>By far the most common kind of screen used on mobile phones is TFT-LCD (often just referred to as LCD, since TFT-based LCD screens are the only type used in practice). It ranges from the budget smartphones like the HTC Desire C to high-end tablets, like the Google Nexus 7.\n\n

TFT-LCD stands for thin-film transistor liquid crystal display and there are many different ways of manufacturing LCD screens, so knowing that a phone is LCD doesn\'t tell you much about its quality.\n\n

In practice, cheap phone screens will often display dull colours, and have narrow viewing angles, which means that if you look at them from off-centre, it becomes hard to see what\'s on-screen.\n\n

High quality LCD screens will have bright, accurate colours and with visibility from just about any angle.\n\n

        All LCD screens need to have a light behind them, which shines through the pixels to make them visible. As a result, they don\'t offer quite the thinness of AMOLED technology.\n\n</item>
        <item>Active-matrix organic light-emitting diode, or AMOLED for short, is a screen technology based on organic compounds that offers high image quality in exchange for potentially very low power usage.\n\n

Unlike LCD screens, AMOLED displays don\'t need a backlight - each pixel produces its own light - so phones using them can potentially be thinner.\n\n

It also means that a mostly black screen will use very little electricity, and true blacks when watching videos, rather than the dark grey some LCD screens produce.\n\n

However, AMOLED screens have proved costly and difficult to produce in the same numbers as LCD, a fact that led to the HTC Desire having its AMOLED screen replaced with Super-LCD halfway through its manufacturing life.\n\n

AMOLED uses a different subpixel arrangement to LCD, which can result in images that don\'t appear quite as sharp.</item>
        <item>This is a derived form of AMOLED screen that actually includes the capacitive touchscreen technology in the manufacturing process, meaning that it doesn\'t have to be overlaid later.\n\n

            It offers other advantages over earlier AMOLED screens, including increased brightness and lower power usage.\n\n

        A new technology first used by the Samsung Galaxy S2. The significant change is in the subpixel construction, switching to something much closer to that used by LCD, which meant sharper, clearer images.\n\n</item>

    <string-array name="compass_descriptions">
        <item>
            Marine compass or a card compass - This type of compass has a needle that is fixed and a compass card that is mounted in fluid and rotates according to orientation. It is used on boats because the moving card absorbs much of the motion of a boat which makes it easier to read than a needle compass.\n\n

Prismatic compass or lensatic compass - has a glass prism or a lens and a lid that has a hairline. These are used for lining up with an object whose bearing is sought. It also has compass card which rotates in the base. When the compass card stops, the required bearing is read off through the prisms or lens. Some of them have liquid as a damping mechanism while other use electromagnetic induction for the same purpose. Some also have tritium and a combination of phosphors which help to read of the compass in the dark.\n\n

Base plate compass or Orienteering compass - is a liquid filled compass placed on the rectangular base made of transparent plastic so a map can be read through it. It often has a magnifying lens for map reading, some sort of light for low light conditions and a ruler. It is often used for plotting.\n\n

Thumb compass - is a variant of base plate compass but smaller. It is fixed on the thumb (as its name says) which leaves one hand free.\n\n

            Solid state compasses - are found in electric devices. They often have two or three magnetic field sensors from which microprocessor reads data about the orientation of the device. They can often be found in clocks, mobile phones and tablets.\n\n

Qibla compass - is used by Muslims to show the direction to Mecca so they would know where to turn while praying.\n\n

GPS compass - uses satellites in a geo synchronous orbit over the Earth to show exact location and direction of movement of bearer.\n\n

Astrocompass - uses positions of various astronomical bodies to find true north. It is used in polar regions where magnetic compasses and gyrocompasses are unreliable. It uses current time and geographical position in the form of latitude and longitude. According to this information, it is sighted on to any astronomical object with a known position to give an extremely accurate reading.\n\n</item>
        <item>The smartphones  have a small magnetometer built in, which can measure the Earth’s magnetic field.\n\n

            This information is combined with an accelerator that acquires information regarding the phone’s position in space.\n\n

            It is able to pinpoint the phone’s position from solid-state sensors within the phone that can measure their tilt and movement.\n\n

            The information provided by these devices means that the compass app can display cardinal directions no matter which orientation the phone is in, according to the algorithmic software development company Sensor Platforms.\n\n</item>
        <item>The compass is able to determine north and south due to the magnet\’s interaction with the Earth\’s magnetic field. \n\n

            The cause of the magnetic field is not clearly  known, but geologists have made hypotheses regarding the phenomenon by analyzing the layers of the Earth.\n\n

            The Earth is made up of an outer crust, followed by the upper mantle, the inner mantle, the outer core, and then finally the inner core at the very center.\n\n

            The inner core is made up mostly of molten iron, but the very center of the inner core is under so much pressure that the molten iron is in a solid form. It is believed that the rotation of the Earth and the immense heat from the core cause the iron to move in a rotational pattern.\n\n

            This rotational pattern may be the source of the magnetic field that we see on Earth. The field produced is very weak, however, which is why the needle on the compass needs to be very lightweight and on a surface with minimal friction.\n\n</item>

    <string-array name="vibrator_descriptions">
        <item>When mobile phones and pagers vibrate, the vibrating alert is produced by a small component that is built into the phone or pager.\n\n

            Many older, non-electronic buzzers and doorbells contain a component that vibrates for the purpose of producing a sound. Tattoo machines and some types of electric engraving tools contain a mechanism that vibrates a needle or cutting tool.\n\n</item>
        <item>A vibrating alert is a feature of communications devices to notify the user of an incoming connection. It is particularly common on mobile phones and pagers and usually supplements the ring tone.\n\n

Vibrating alerts are primarily used when a user cannot hear the ring tone (a noisy environment or through hearing loss) or wants a more discreet notification. However, when the device is placed on a hard surface, it can often be as loud or louder than a ringtone. Most 21st-century mobile phones are fitted with a vibrating alert.\n\n

The vibrating alert is produced by a small electric motor connected to an off-center weight.\n\n</item>
        <item>Modern vibration motors for mobile devices have, depending on their type, a MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure) of 10.000~30.000 hours.\n\n
So even if your phone vibrator would run 1h per day (which it doesn\'t, it\'s probably less than half, since it\'s rarely vibrating constantly), it\'s not expected to fail for 10.000 days\n\n.</item>

    <string-array name="av_descriptions">
        <item>Audio connectors and video connectors are electrical connectors (or optical connectors) - plugs and sockets - for carrying audio signal and video signal.\n\n

Audio interfaces and video interfaces define physical parameters and interpretation of signals. For digital audio and digital video, this can be thought of as defining the physical layer, data link layer, and most or all of the application layer.\n\n

            For analog audio and analog video these functions are all represented in a single signal specification like NTSC or the direct speaker-driving signal of analog audio. Physical characteristics of the electrical or optical equipment includes the types and numbers of wires required, voltages, frequencies, optical intensity, and the physical design of the connectors.\n\n

            Any data link layer details define how application data is encapsulated (for example for synchronization or error-correction). Application layer details define the actual audio or video format being transmitted, often incorporating a codecs not specific to the interface, such as PCM, MPEG-2, or the DTS Coherent Acoustics codec. In some cases, the application layer is left open; for example, HDMI contains an Ethernet channel for general data transmission.\n\n

Some types of connectors are used by multiple hardware interfaces; for example, RCA connectors are defined both by the composite video and component video interfaces, but DVI is the only interface that uses the DVI connector. This means that in some cases not all components with physically compatible connectors will actually work together.\n\n

Some of these connectors, and other types of connectors, are also used at radio frequency (RF) to connect a radio or television receiver to an antenna or to a cable system; RF connector applications are not further described here. Analog A/V connectors often use shielded cables to inhibit radio frequency interference (RFI) and noise.\n\n</item>
        <item>Audio connectors are used for audio frequencies. They can be analog or digital.\n\n

Single-wire connectors used frequently for analog audio include:\n\n

Banana connectors\n
Spade connectors\n
Five-way binding posts and banana plugs for loudspeakers\n
Fahnestock clips on early breadboard radio receivers.\n
Euroblock \"European-style terminal block\" or \"Phoenix connectors\", screw terminal connectors used for audio and control signals\n\n

        A phone connector (tip, ring, sleeve) also called an audio jack, phone plug, jack plug, stereo plug, mini-jack, or mini-stereo. This includes the original 6.35mm (quarter inch) jack and the more recent 3.5mm (miniature or 1/8 inch) and 2.5mm (subminiature) jacks, both mono and stereo versions.\n\n
        </item>
        <item>Video connectors carry only video signals. Common video-only connectors include:\n\n

Component video aka YPbPr (3 RCA or BNC; or D-Terminal)\n
Composite video (1 RCA, Antenna socket, or BNC)\n
DB13W3 (\"13W3\" computer video connector)\n
DMS-59, single connector carrying two DVI and two VGA\n
Musa, British connector used in broadcasting and telecommunications\n
PAL connector, common in Europe as an antenna connector\n
S-Video (1 Mini-DIN)\n
SDI - Broadcast grade digital interface over BNC cables\n
VGA connector A type of D-sub connector standard on most video cards\n\n</item>
        <item>A phone connector, also known as phone jack, audio jack, headphone jack or jack plug, is a family of electrical connectors typically used for analog audio signals.\n\n

The phone connector was invented for use in telephone switchboards in the 19th century and is still widely used.\n\n

The phone connector is cylindrical in shape, with a grooved tip to retain it. In its original audio configuration, it typically has two, three, four and, occasionally, five contacts.\n\n

            Three-contact versions are known as TRS connectors, where T stands for \"tip\", R stands for \"ring\" and S stands for \"sleeve\". Ring contacts are typically the same diameter as the sleeve, the long shank.\n\n

            Similarly, two-, four- and five- contact versions are called TS, TRRS and TRRRS connectors respectively. The outside diameter of the \"sleeve\" conductor is 1⁄4 inch (6.35 millimetres). The \"mini\" connector has a diameter of 3.5 mm (0.14 in) and the \"sub-mini\" connector has a diameter of 2.5 mm (0.098 in).\n\n</item>

    <string-array name="battery_descriptions">
        <item><b>Battery is one of the most important parts of a mobile phone or a tablet as this is what keeps the device mobile.</b>\n\n

        Mobile phones and tablets these days come with different types of batteries and it is their quality that decides how much energy they can store and hence how long the device can be operated with a single charge.

There are also limitations on size and weight as a big battery would make the device heavy and bulky, which is not a comfortable option. So, designers work on basically three parameters of a battery - chemical composition, size, and weight.

In terms of chemical composition, there are only two types of batteries used in modern cell phones Lithium Polymer and Lithium Ion.
</item>
        <item>Li-Poly is the latest and most advanced technology for cell phone batteries. This makes the batteries ultra-lightweight, they do not suffer from memory effect and will deliver up to 40 per cent more battery capacity than a Nickel Metal Hybrid (NiMH) (one that you use in your camera) of the same size.\n\n

        \"Memory effect\" happens when rechargeable batteries are not fully discharged between charge cycles; as a result the battery \"remembers\" the shortened cycle and is thus reduces its capacity. Devices like Blackberry PlayBook, Samsung Galaxy S3 use this type of battery.\n\n</item>
        <item>This is the older and most popular technology for cell phone batteries. The only real drawback of Lithium Ion cell phone batteries is that they are expensive. However, they have higher energy density compared to Li-Polymer.\n\n

Both Li-ion and Li Polymer batteries have the same chemical composition but the difference lies in their tendency to overheat. Because of this, Lithium Ion batteries have an active protection circuit—essentially an onboard computer—that prevents the battery from overheating and potentially bursting into flame.\n\n

Lithium polymer batteries do not need the active protection circuit, which is why it is possible to manufacture them in sizes as small as a credit card.\n\n</item>
        <item>Another feature that distinguishes different batteries is its usage pattern - replaceable and non-replaceable.\n\n

In case of non-replaceable battery, it is called a Li-ion pouch cell which is a sealed bag containing carefully layered anode and cathode sheets, with separators between them. All of these layers are infused with a liquid electrolyte.\n\n

At one end of the battery, a printed circuit board (PCB) is connected to the positive and negative terminals of each cell that provides active protection against short circuits, overcharge, and forced discharge.\n\n

            Li-ion pouch cells tend to be fragile and rely on the smartphone case for protection, and so officially are not user-replaceable. This basically reduces the need for a separate battery casing which is the case with user replaceable batteries. Please note that these casing constitute most of the volume of the battery.\n\n

Circuits also determine how much power can be stored. Ever since Li-Ion technology came into being in early nineties, a lot of work has gone into the making of better electronic circuit to manage the battery and thereby squeezing more energy into the same battery.\n\n</item>

    <string-array name="bluetooth_descriptions">
        <item>Bluetooth is a short-range, wireless networking standard used by mobile phones and other peripherals.\n\n

You can use Bluetooth to connect your mobile phone wirelessly to a Bluetooth headset or to transfer data back and forth with a Bluetooth-equipped computer.\n\n

Bluetooth transfer speeds depend on the version of Bluetooth being used:\n\n

Bluetooth 1.2: 1.2 Mbit/s\n
Bluetooth 2.0 + EDR (Extended Data Rate): 3 Mbit/s\n
The exact functionality of a Bluetooth device is dictated by the Bluetooth Profile embedded into it. For instance, the Apple iPhone doesn\'t include the profile needed for data transfer to and from the phone - so its Bluetooth functionality is limited to connecting to headsets.\n\n</item>
        <item>To understand how a Bluetooth connection works, we need an example of the wireless technology being used, so let’s take a phone connected to wireless speaker. First, each device is equipped with Bluetooth connectivity, a feature that requires both software and hardware components. On the hardware side, an antenna-equipped chip in both devices sends and receives signals at a specific frequency. The software interprets incoming Bluetooth signals and sends them out in ways other devices can read and understand. In the case of the wireless speaker, the phone will know how to send audio files and information in a format that the speaker understands, while the speaker can interpret these signals–as well as other indicators such as volume and track controls–from the phone.\n\n

When two devices are equipped with Bluetooth, usually one of them will to be set to be discoverable, meaning it’ll show up in a list of Bluetooth devices in the area on your phone or other controlling device. Using our example, the wireless speaker would be discoverable, and it will end up being controlled by a Bluetooth-equipped phone or remote. The speaker, or any Bluetooth accessory, sends out a signal with a little bit of information to alert other nearby devices of its presence and capabilities. You tell your phone to connect, and the two devices form a personal area network, or piconet.\n\n

From this point on, the two devices know to connect with each other based on the unique address within their respective signals. No matter what other signals come in on wavelengths in which those devices operate, they will always detect, read, and send the correct signals. Bluetooth signals have a limited range, which prevents massive amounts of conflicting data covering huge areas and interrupting communication between other devices. In other words, your speaker will always know that you’re the one who is trying to listen to Nickelback, even if it doesn’t know how to criticize you for it.\n\n</item>
        <item>According to the Bluetooth website, the technology \“operates in the unlicensed industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) band at 2.4 to 2.485GHz, using a spread spectrum, frequency hopping, full-duplex signal at a nominal rate of 1600 hops/sec\”. If you fell asleep part way through that, let\’s break it down to find out exactly how your headset knows to pick up calls from your phone.\n\n

Bluetooth chips produce wavelengths that are bound to frequencies operating within a range specifically set aside for this sort of short-range communication. Other devices you might find that use this frequency include cordless telephones and baby monitors. However, there is an issue with always using the same frequency. Other devices operating at the same, or close, frequencies can cause interruptions in the signal.\n\n

To prevent this from being an issue, the signal is spread out over a wider range of frequencies. In order to achieve this, the signal hops around the frequency, and in the case of Bluetooth that happens about 1600 times per second. The frequent change in wavelength means that even a consistent signal won\’t interrupt, and won\’t be interrupted, for longer than 1/1600th of a second.\n\n

Bluetooth headsets can sync up in two different ways, using a full or part duplex connection. A full-duplex signal means that all connected devices are able to send and receive signals – in this case a two-way conversation – simultaneously, as opposed to a half-duplex signal, like a walkie-talkie, where each side can still talk and listen, just not both at the same time.\n\n</item>
        <item>Bluetooth has evolved to be a perfect mobile connectivity option, because it doesn\’t take much energy, and the signal isn\’t broadcast for miles. Minimum standards require that Bluetooth chips have at least 10 meters (about 30 feet) of range unless they\’re being used in closed circumstances. Even industrial uses of Bluetooth typically don’t have a range greater than 300 feet. The data transfer speed of Bluetooth isn’t particularly high, so while uses like streaming music or talking on the phone are fine, transferring larger amounts of data would take far too long to be practical. The low power consumption is also important when Bluetooth is used in our mobile devices, where the last thing we need is something else draining our precious battery.\n\n

In addition, Bluetooth 4.0 brought a new low power option that allows wireless objects to operate for long periods of time, even on the smallest of batteries. This enables all sorts of useful devices to be incorporated into the Internet of Things, from showerheads to ovens to countertops. These kinds of connections are part of the work being done to create greater connectivity between everyday objects, and the already heavily-used Bluetooth protocol will surely be a part of that movement. The newest version of the protocol, 4.1, also enables greater communication alongside powerful wireless connections like LTE, further increasing the versatility of Bluetooth and connected devices.\n\n</item>

        <item>Using Your Phone Over Wi-Fi</item>
        <item>How It Works</item>
    </string-array>

    <string-array name="wifi_descriptions">
        <item>Wi-Fi, which is a trademark of the Wi-Fi Alliance, is short for wireless fidelity. Wi-Fi\’s origins can be traced back to an FCC ruling in 1985.\n\n

A device with Wi-Fi can wirelessly connect to the internet when it’s in a range of a wireless router that is hardwired to the internet. Wi-Fi-enabled devices can include:\n\n

Mobile phones\n
Personal computers\n
Video game consoles\n
Home appliances (lightbulbs, stereos systems, TVs)\n\n</item>
        <item>Some mobile phones are Wi-Fi enabled and some are not. When a mobile phone has embedded Wi-Fi technology, the handset can access the Internet through a nearby wireless router. In doing so, the Wi-Fi-enabled mobile phone circumvents a cell phone carrier\’s network and is not charged or counted for data usage. Wi-Fi cannot replace a voice call with mobile phones.\n\n

A Wi-Fi-enabled mobile phone can link to a wireless router at your home, a coffee shop, a business or anywhere with an active wireless router. Wi-Fi connections in airports, hotels, bars, coffee shops and more are traditionally called hot spots. Some Wi-Fi hotspots are free and some cost money. To establish a Wi-Fi connection between a mobile phone and a wireless router, it is very likely that login credentials (i.e. a password) will be required.\n\n

Mobile phones use different technologies (such as GSM with T-Mobile or CDMA with Sprint). Wi-Fi, on the other hand, is a global standard. Unlike with mobile phones, any Wi-Fi device will work anywhere in the world.\n\n</item>
        <item>Wi-Fi requires high power consumption when used with mobile devices. As mobile phones perform more and more tasks by the day, Wi-Fi can be an energy drain for such handsets. \n\n

            Wi-Fi networks have a limited range; a traditional wireless router using the 802.11b or 802.11g standard with a regular antenna can work within a range of 120 feet indoors to 300 feet outdoors.\n\n</item>
        <item>Wi-Fi is a wireless internet connection that you can use to connect devices like phones to the internet. Most home broadband routers have Wi-Fi connections, and many public places like cafes and libraries offer them too.\n\n

If you\'re connected using Wi-Fi we won\'t charge you for using data as it means you\'re not connected to the internet over our network. If you\’re using it on a home broadband Wi-Fi, you should contact your internet provider to find out about any potential data allowances you have with them.\n\n

If you don\’t have all-you-can-eat data and you\’re worried about going over your data allowance, you might want to use Wi-Fi to connect to the internet on your phone if you\'re doing things that use a lot of data, like downloading large app or phone operating system updates.\n\n

When you\’re connected to Wi-Fi, your calls and texts still go over our network, but data use goes through your Wi-Fi connection rather than our network. This means that using data while connected to Wi-Fi won\’t come out of your data allowance. It also means that you can’t connect to certain secure services on our network, like your My3 account. To use My3, you’ll need to turn off your Wi-Fi connection in your phone’s settings.\n\n</item>
        <item>
When you make a call on a WiFi phone, you dial the number of the person you want to call, just like you would with a cell phone. If you\'re calling another VoIP user, you may enter a VoIP address instead of a phone number, depending on the service provider\'s requirements.\n\n

The phone translates the number you dial into packets of data. It uses radio waves to transmit the packets to a wireless receiver. The receiver passes the information over the Internet to the call processor like an ordinary VoIP call. When you begin your conversation, the phone transmits your voice in packets of data as well. Your voice travels just like it does in a VoIP call, although the specifics can differ from one provider to another.\m\m

            Many of these phones use a specific WiFi service or network. For example, Netgear makes a WiFi phone for Skype service, and UTStarcom makes a WiFi phone for Vonage service. In order to use either of these phones, you need to have an account with that provider, just like you need a service plan from a cell phone provider to use a particular phone. Either you or your service provider will configure the phone to work within the network.\n\n

Other phones work with a protocol rather than a particular network or provider. For example, ZyXEL and Linksys both make WiFi phones that use Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). SIP is one of several VoIP protocols — you can find out more about them at Protocols.com. After setting up a SIP phone, you can make calls simply by entering the other party\'s SIP address and pressing \"Send.\"\n\n

SIP is an open protocol. Anyone can use it, and anyone who has a SIP address can contact anyone else who has one for free. SIP is a standard protocol for handling voice data, and many VoIP providers use it, even though they maintain a closed network. It can also control other forms of communication, like instant messaging and video conferencing.\n\n

Eventually, SIP will probably make communications tools interoperable. In other words, your computer, phone, PDA and other communications tools could all share the same address book and communicate with one another.\n\n

        <item>How Are Speakers Tiny Yet Loud?</item>

        <item>Audio Software And Hardware</item>
    </string-array>

    <string-array name="sound_descriptions">
        <item>Speakers and phones have developed hand-in-hand for over 150 years. The first speakers were used in telephone receivers, shortly afterwards they branched off into sound reinforcement and grew larger and more powerful.\n\n

In the 1980s and 90s things came full circle. Modern mobile phones have two speakers. One, still called a receiver, is in the earpiece. The second is for sound reinforcement, for things like ringtones, music playback and hands-free calling.\n\n

Micro speakers try to bridge the gap, aiming to produce room-filling sound from a tiny volume. What began with a move to play better polyphonic ringtones has now grown towards using a cell phone instead of a home stereo. These speakers are caught between two opposing trends, more output power and smaller size. As these trends accelerate, speaker designers are starting to look for new and innovative ways to get the best possible sound.\n\n

Modern micro speakers have a permanent magnet and a voice coil that is attached to a diaphragm that pushes the air to create sound. The entire speaker is enclosed in protective box that provides the \"back volume\" for the speaker to push against and project the sound from the speaker.\n\n</item>
        <item>Mobile speakers aren\'t especially loud. My phone puts out about as many decibels at maximum volume as my regular speakers do at 30-40% of maximum.\n\n

            But there\'s a difference between actual loudness and perceived loudness. Mobile speakers feel loud because they produce only high frequencies. (Your ear fills in some of the low-frequency information by inference from its higher overtones.) \n\n

            High frequency sound is shrill and attention-grabbing. When sounds get attenuated by distance or obstacles, the high frequencies are the first to get filtered out. So when all the high frequencies are present, our brain thinks we\'re hearing something at full blast.\n\n</item>
        <item>It\'s a remarkably common quirk of handset speaker placement that people who hold their phones in their right hand seem to suffer more from muffled speakers than lefties - wherever on the phone they\'re placed - so daft as it sounds, try switching hands.\n\n

By the same token, those of us who use a protective case for our phones should check those aren\'t covering the speakers - most are designed to account for them, but it\'s surprising how many aren\'t.\n\n

Phones with front facing speakers have the advantage here because whether we\'re watching videos, gaming, or streaming music, the speakers are probably going to be facing us - but beware covering one or both with a thumb while gaming or watching videos.\n\n

A phone with a rear facing speaker is always going to present a challenge when we want to see the screen at the same time - but when that\'s not an issue, it\'s simplicity itself: rest the phone on its front, or so the speaker is pointing towards you to get the best sound.\n\n</item>
        <item>Sound is a very physical thing - soundwaves are vibrations, after all - but those vibrations are the result of digital signals being processed, and the audio processing software used by a manufacturer can make a big difference to the sound quality.\n\n

Some phone manufacturers put a lot of time and effort into their audio software, not just thinking about how it\'ll work when pumping the signal through the headphone jack, but how to make it work with the phone\'s speakers - which they\'ll probably have taken some considerable care in designing.\n\n

Expect to find such manufacturers paying attention to trying to provide a better balance between frequencies - or giving us the ability to adjust them, at least, in the form of accessible global equalizers and other audio settings.\n\n

They may also invest in higher bitrate processors and digital to analogue converters (DACs); while there are plenty of perfectly serviceable and very well regarded DACs made by chipset makers, some phones feature DACs made by dedicated audio companies like Bang and Olufsen.\n\n

If we\'re determined to listen to audio via a phone\'s internal speakers, there\'s not much we can do in this regard, other than look for a handset made by one of the manufacturers that puts in this kind of effort - Apple, HTC, and Sony are known for their attention to audio, and the newer LG handsets feature better than standard processors.\n\n</item>

        <item>Without A Gyroscope…</item>

    </string-array>

    <string-array name="gyroscope_descriptions">
        <item>Accelerometers in mobile phones are used to detect the orientation of the phone. The gyroscope, or gyro for short, adds an additional dimension to the information supplied by the accelerometer by tracking rotation or twist.\n\n

An accelerometer measures linear acceleration of movement, while a gyro on the other hand measures the angular rotational velocity. Both sensors measure rate of change; they just measure the rate of change for different things.\n\n

In practice, that means that an accelerometer will measure the directional movement of a device but will not be able to resolve its lateral orientation or tilt during that movement accurately unless a gyro is there to fill in that info.\n\n

With an accelerometer you can either get a really \"noisy\" info output that is responsive, or you can get a \"clean\" output that\'s sluggish. But when you combine the 3-axis accelerometer with a 3-axis gyro, you get an output that is both clean and responsive in the same time.\"\n\n</item>
        <item>Without gyroscope there are some loses of features in your phone:\n\n
 1. You cannot play a game that involves circular motion for instance counter strike.\n
 2. With out gyroscope Orientation of the phone Horizontal and vertical orientation of the device may not be sensitive.\n
 3. Your smartphone is unable to measure the tilt angle.\n
 4. Accelerometer alone will not provide orientation of the smartphone precisely without the help of gyroscope.\n
 5. Images in your phone cannot be viewed in tilt because of no gyroscope.\n
 6. You cannot use applications that works based on gyroscope.\n\n</item>
        <item>The gyroscope is a massive rotor that is fixed in light supporting rings called gimbals. The gimbals consist of frictionless bearings that isolate the central rotor from outside torques. The axle of the spinning wheel defines the spin axis.\n\n

The rotor possesses three degrees of rotational freedom and spins about an axis. It acquires extraordinary stability of balance at high speeds as it maintains the high speed rotation axis of its central rotor.</item>
        \n\n
        <item>When the gyroscope is applied with external torques or rotations about the given axis, the orientation can be measured by a precession phenomenon. When an object rotating about an axis is applied with external torque along a direction perpendicular to the rotational axis, the precession occurs.\n\n

This rotation about the spin axis is detected and information on this rotation is delivered to a motor or other device that applies torque in an opposite direction thereby canceling the precession and maintaining its orientation.\n\n

The precession can also be prevented using two gyroscopes that are arranged perpendicular to each other. The rotation rate can be measured by the pulsation of counteracting torque at constant time intervals.\n\n

    <string-array name="gravity_descriptions">
        <item>Gravity sensor is an accelerometer. An accelerometer is a device that measures proper acceleration (\"g-force\"). Proper acceleration is not the same as coordinate acceleration (rate of change of velocity).\n\n

            For example, an accelerometer at rest on the surface of the Earth will measure an acceleration g= 9.81 m/s2 straight upwards. By contrast, accelerometers in free fall orbiting and accelerating due to the gravity of Earth will measure zero.\n\n

Accelerometers have multiple applications in industry and science. Highly sensitive accelerometers are components of inertial navigation systems for aircraft and missiles. Accelerometers are used to detect and monitor vibration in rotating machinery.\n\n

            Accelerometers are used in tablet computers and digital cameras so that images on screens are always displayed upright. Accelerometers are used in drones for flight stabilisation. Pairs of accelerometers extended over a region of space can be used to detect differences (gradients) in the proper accelerations of frames of references associated with those points.\n\n

            These devices are called gravity gradiometers, as they measure gradients in the gravitational field. Such pairs of accelerometers in theory may also be able to detect gravitational waves.\n\n</item>
        <item>Single- and multi-axis models of accelerometer are available to detect magnitude and direction of the proper acceleration (or g-force), as a vector quantity, and can be used to sense orientation (because direction of weight changes), coordinate acceleration (so long as it produces g-force or a change in g-force), vibration, shock, and falling in a resistive medium (a case where the proper acceleration changes, since it starts at zero, then increases).\n\n

            Micromachined accelerometers are increasingly present in portable electronic devices and video game controllers, to detect the position of the device or provide for game input.\n\n</item>
        <item>An accelerometer measures proper acceleration, which is the acceleration it experiences relative to freefall and is the acceleration felt by people and objects.\n\n

            Put another way, at any point in space-time the equivalence principle guarantees the existence of a local inertial frame, and an accelerometer measures the acceleration relative to that frame. Such accelerations are popularly measured in terms of g-force.\n\n

An accelerometer at rest relative to the Earth\'s surface will indicate approximately 1 g upwards, because any point on the Earth\'s surface is accelerating upwards relative to the local inertial frame (the frame of a freely falling object near the surface).\n\n

            To obtain the acceleration due to motion with respect to the Earth, this \"gravity offset\" must be subtracted and corrections made for effects caused by the Earth\'s rotation relative to the inertial frame.\n\n</item>
        <item>A number of 21st century devices use accelerometers to align the screen depending on the direction the device is held, for example switching between portrait and landscape modes. Such devices include many tablet PCs and some smartphones and digital cameras.\n\n

            The Amida Simputer, a handheld Linux device launched in 2004, was the first commercial handheld to have a built-in accelerometer. It had incorporated many gesture based interactions using this accelerometer, including page-turning, zoom-in and zoom-out of images, change of portrait to landscape mode and many simple gesture-based games.\n\n

As of January 2009, almost all new mobile phones and digital cameras contain at least a tilt sensor and sometimes an accelerometer for the purpose of auto image rotation, motion-sensitive mini-games, and to correct shake when taking photographs.\n\n</item>
        <item>Camcorders use accelerometers for image stabilization. Still cameras use accelerometers for anti-blur capturing. The camera holds off capturing the image when the camera is moving.\n\n

            When the camera is still (if only for a millisecond, as could be the case for vibration), the image is captured. An example of the application of this technology is the Glogger VS2, a phone application which runs on Symbian based phones with accelerometers such as the Nokia N96. Some digital cameras contain accelerometers to determine the orientation of the photo being taken and also for rotating the current picture when viewing.\n\n</item>

    <string-array name="linear_acceleration_descriptions">
        <item>The accelerometer is a built-in component for measuring the acceleration of any mobile device. Motions like swinging, tilting, rotating, shaking is detected using accelerometer. The value of XYZ is used to calculate and detect the motions. Besides mobile, the accelerometer is used to measure vibration on cars, machines, buildings, process control systems and safety installations.\n\n

Biologically it is used by researchers to quantify the rate at which an animal is dissipating energy in the wild by determining the limb-stroke frequency and overall dynamic body acceleration. In some medical applications, the accelerometer is deployed in pedometer for counting each step of a person involved in physical trainings like running, jogging, etc. Accelerometer used in navigator measures the motion of the person and shows the pointer in the map (as in Google map application).\b\b</item>
        <item>The accelerometer in the mobile device provides the XYZ coordinate values, which is used to measure the position and the acceleration of the device. The XYZ coordinate represents direction and position of the device at which acceleration occurred.\n\n

            The rotation direction and position are measured using gyroscope sensors that are found in the Android devices. The mobile device rest in the Earth includes the acceleration due to gravity (g = 9.81m/s2) and the acceleration value.\n\n

            The accelerometer values provided by the device normally includes the gravity as well. Accelerometer along with the linear acceleration and gyroscope will provide results close to accuracy. Linear acceleration does not include the gravity. The accelerometer value is passed into the low/high pass filters for refining the result, based on the application that has been used.\n\n</item>
        <item>List of field applications that use accelerometer:\n\n

Engineering – Car, machines, buildings\n
Biology – Animal dynamic body acceleration\n
Industry – Turbines, pumps, fans, compressors\n
Building and structures – Moving loads on bridges, earthquakes and aftershocks\n
Medical application – pedometer, CRP D-Padz\n
Transport – Intelligent compaction rollers, trains to detect tilts\n
Volcanology – Motion of magma in active volcanoes\n
Consumer electronics – Display screens, hard disk\n\n</item>
        <item>The accelerometer sensor/component is device-centric (according to manufacturer), so the accuracy of the acceleration values differs from device to device.\n\n

            So before building an application, you should have built your device with accelerometer by the same manufacturer. Limitations are there; but they vary based on environmental conditions.\n\n</item>

    <string-array name="rotation_vector_descriptions">
        <item>The older ORIENTATION sensors report orientation using three angles. The problem with this coordinate systems is that it suffers from \"gimbal lock\": when the actual orientation vector is close to vertical, one of the coordinates goes to 90 or -90 degrees, and the remaining two coordinates become either uninterpretable or dangerously denormalized.\n\n

The newer ROTATION sensors report orientation using quarternion coordinates, which are more complicated to work with, but don\'t suffer from the Gimbal lock problem. When orientation is reported using quaternion coordinates, you can determine the precise orientation of the device no matter what the orientation is.\n\n

Quaternions are also more computationally efficient. You don\'t need to call expensive trig functions to apply a quaternion rotation to a vector. If the w coordinate isn\'t supplied you can still compute w with a single sqrt call, compared to three sin and three cos function calls for orientation coordinates in the three angle Euler form.\n\n</item>
        <item>Geomagnetic Rotation Vector sensor consists of an accelerometer + magnetometer  which helps in conserving battery while using apps like Gmaps, Compass, etc.\n\n

            That sensor is helps in finding where the phone is pointed at, wrt magnetic poles and the phones orientation(landscape or portrait). From the data obtained from the sensor, 3d mapping can be drawn onto the screen which brings a visual flair over 2d.\n\n

            This sensor is continuously powered and consumes very low amount of battery when compared to Game Rotation Vector (accelerometer + gyroscope), which is more sensitive than GeoRV and is triggered on by games which takes input data about the phone\'s tilt in 3-Dimension.\n\n</item>

    <string-array name="magnetic_field_descriptions">
        <item>The magnetic sensor, better known as magnetometer, measures earth\’s magnetic field. This in addition with software algorithms determines direction your phone is facing.\n\n</item>
        <item>The magnetometer sensor in your tablet or smartphone also utilizes the modern solid state technology to create a miniature Hall-effect sensor that detects the Earth\'s magnetic field along three perpendicular axes X, Y and Z.\n\n

            The Hall-effect sensor produces voltage which is proportional to the strength and polarity of the magnetic field along the axis each sensor is directed. The sensed voltage is converted to digital signal representing the magnetic field intensity.\n\n

            Other technologies used for magnetometer may include magneto resistive devices which change the measured resistance based on changes in the magnetic field.\n\n

The magnetometer is enclosed in a small electronic chip that often incorporate another sensor (typically a built in accelerometer) that help to correct the raw magnetic measurements using tilt information from the auxiliary sensor.\n\n

In addition to general rotational information, the magnetometer is crucial for detecting the relative orientation of your device relative to the Earth\'s magnetic north.\n\n</item>
        <item>Sophisticated smart phone applications such as maps or augmented reality use measurements of the Earth\'s magnetic and gravity fields to work out the orientation of the phone.\n\n

A typical smart phone has three magnetic field sensors, fixed perpendicular to each other, which are used to work out the local direction of Magnetic North.\n\n

In addition, they have three accelerometers which sense gravity to give tilt information and to help work out which way is down.\n\n

        The application software uses the location of the phone from the mobile phone\’s nearest base-station or from a GPS reading along with a map of the declination of the magnetic field (produced by BGS and NOAA in the USA) to work out the direction of True North at the user\'s location.\n\n</item>
        <item>Magnetic and gravity field sensors located within your phone measure the direction of Magnetic North and the downward direction at the phone\'s location.\n\n

Using the GPS coordinates of the phone location and a global map of declination angle (the angle between true north and magnetic north) the application software computes the required correction angle for True North.\n\n

The map or image shown to the user can now be correctly orientated to True North, which is what most people expect.\n\n</item>
        <item>As is evident from the basics of smartphone navigation mentioned above, GPS and AGPS are sufficient to provide you with basic navigation. When your GPS sensor is week or the GPS signal is week, as is the case with many budget smartphones, you can use A-GPS, using the linked tutorial.\n\n

The Magnetic sensor in your smartphone is not an actual magnet, it is however capable of sensing the magnetic field of earth (using Halls effect) and determining your Direction. With magnetic Compass turned on while using the navigation app, your navigation will be more precise.\n\n

The Magnetic sensor will show minute details like change in your orientation as well. You can change your direction and you will be able to see that on your smartphone screen. This is particularly help full when you are using navigation on foot. In the Absence of magnetic senor you can see your position on the Map but, not your orientation. the Map doesn\’t rotate when you do. Magnetic sensor helps you to take that first step in the correct direction with the help of the direction pointer.\n\n

Thus Magnetic sensor adds details to enhance your navigation experience, but it is not a necessity. Good navigation primarily requires good GPS receiver and Good A-GPS synchronization.\n\n</item>

        <item>Using a Pedometer helps in keeping track of the steps you take while doing aerobics, running, walking, steps exercise.\n\n

            While starting any fitness activity, You set some goals and would like to monitor it. E.g. If you have to prepare for a marathon which is 2 months away, You make a schedule of running every morning.\n\n

            Now you run everyday and follow the same or different path. Sometimes you feel very tired and reduce the distance or sometimes you increase the distance, But you do not have track of whether your stamina or performance is increasing or not.\n\n

            If you do your activity using the Pedometer, It will capture the details like distance covered each day, Steps taken and duration. You can review your performance after days and weeks to check whether it is improving or not.\n\n</item>
        <item>It is close to the actual count but need to be  started and stopped at right time.e.g. If you start the app before starting your jogging and end it after you complete it, then the count will be near to the actual count.\n\n

            But if you start the app, and talk on phone or play some game on it, then chances are that this activity will increase the step count.\n\n

            One obvious question is that can these applications record all the steps taken by a person with the app on the phone in a day? The answer is, It can provide a rough idea of it but not accurate numbers. Some of the tasks like picking up the phone ,putting it down, sliding it , holding it for clicking picture etc. may also increase the step count.\n\n</item>
        <item>It does not matter where you keep it and you should keep it at a place where you are comfortable for free body movement. You can keep it in pocket,in jacket,  hold it in hand or keep it in purse.\n\n

            As long as it is directly or indirectly attached to your body during motion it will give the number of steps. Also it does not matter whether you keep your phone straight or upside down.\n\n

            These applications work without GPS also, So we can assume that it does not need GPS for step counting. But if the application has other features like showing the map of the track you followed while jogging, then GPS will be required.\n\n
        </item>
        <item>These applications work with the phones which have the Accelerometer sensor built in it. While running, this application will monitor the change in accelerometer and based on it will conclude if the step is taken.\n\n

            It can provide the information about the angle at which you are holding the device, direction , speed at which it is moved and the gravity. Accelerometer provides the values whenever they are changed along with the Time at which the event occurred. Application stores these values in the database and look for a pattern.\n\n

An accelerometer will provide three values x-axis value, y-axis value and z-axis value. As the person starts taking the first step, x-axis value will increase at a rate depending upon the force at which the person starts to move, y-axis which will tell the relative change in the height of the device along with the force will show an increase in value as while taking the step person will rise from the ground and then it will decrease till the step touches the ground.\n\n

            Based on this kind of pattern match, Step event is detected. Same kind of concept is used in wave to answer feature provided in phones.\n\n</item>

        <item>The ambient (ATC) or outside air temperature sensor is an (NTC) negative temperature coefficient sensor that informs the semiautomatic/automatic temperature control system of outside air temperature.\n\n

            The NTC sensor\’s resistance decreases as the outside air temperature increases. The computer uses this input, along with other in-car temperature sensors to control temperature and blower speed. When there\’s a problem with this sensor, performance will suffer and the compressor\’s clutch may not engage.\n\n

Ambient air temperature sensor symptoms, like an inoperative clutch or input problems are diagnosed with a scan tool and a multimeter. Factory and many generic scan tools have the capability to activate certain components; the compressor clutch is one of them.\n\n

            If the clutch engages with the scan tool, there is likely a problem with one of the inputs. Verify any suspicions with a visual inspection of the sensor and its connector. Use a multimeter and verify manufacturer\'s specifications, (~ 220-240 ohms at 70°-80° F), to test this sensor for proper resistance.\n\n

        Automotive air conditioning systems use NTC sensors to monitor air temperature. The In Car Temperature sensor (ICTS) is an NTC that monitors the air temperature of the passenger compartment. The ambient temperature sensor (ATS) monitors the air temperature outside of the vehicle. The EATC compares these values and makes output decisions based on the difference of these air temperatures.\n\n</item>
        <item>The ambient ( ATC ) or outside air temperature sensor is an ( NTC ) negative temperature coefficient sensing unit that informs the semiautomatic/automatic climate manage program of outside air temperature. The NTC sensor\’s resilience diminishes as the outside air warmth increases.\n\n

            The computer utilizes this input, as well as other in-car temperature sensors to manage temperature and blower speed. When there\’s an issue with this sensor, performance will endure and the compressor\’s grapple may not employ.\n\n

Ambient air temperature sensor indicators, like an inoperative clutch or input issues are identified as having a scan tool and a multimeter. Factory and many common scan tools have the ability to activate certain details; the compressor clutch is amongst them. If the clutch gets involved with the scan tool, there is certainly likely a problem with among the inputs. Verify any uncertainties with a visual examination of the sensor. Now you can use advance Wifi Temperature Sensor or wifi ambient temperature sensors.</item>
        <item>Almost every device has an internal temperature sensor which monitors the CPU and battery temperature of device. Now if there is another temperature sensor to measure the air temperature, it should be implanted far enough from the  battery and CPU and also should be on the outer side of the device.\n\n

            Even such measures are kept, we cannot rule out the possibility that its reading would be affected by the overall temperature of the mobile. It would be hard to get an accurate ambient temperature. And It should be the reason that not every Smartphone has such a sensor and even Samsung stopped equipping its devices with a temperature monitor.\n\n

S-Health app of Galaxy S4 and Note 3 has clear directions about the use of temperature sensor that before you take air temperature with the device, you should let the device sufficiently cool off, put the device down on a stationary surface and not hold the device in your hand. These directions are there so that device is not heated up and the temperature sensor gives you an accurate idea of ambient temperature.\n\n

After Samsung, Motorola fit temperature sensor in its two mobile phones. These mobiles were Moto X and Moto X Second Generation. But we are not sure how accurate their sensors are.\n\n

If users are to be believed the temperature and humidity sensors of galaxy Note 3 and Galaxy S4 do not give as accurate reading with S-Health as they give when they utilize Weather Station app of A Minor.\n\n

            With this app, you can set your own personal weather station which does not depend upon Satellite Weather Station. It uses the temperature and humidity sensor of your device i.e. Galaxy Note 3 and Galaxy S6\n\n</item>
        <item>The Samsung Galaxy S4 and the S4 Active\n\n

The S4 is the phone that has brought a dedicated temperature sensor to the masses. While it is not the first phone to contain a thermometer, it is the first internationally available device to do so. I\’m not going to write much about the sensors in the S4 because we all know they’re awesome, but unfortunately not cheap.\n\n

        Anything from the Arrows line:\n\n

These were among the first phones to use the Sensirion SHTC1 (the same chip in the S4). The devices are high spec, but they\’re probably not going to be that much use to you unless you have a working knowledge of Japanese. Incidentally these devices have some crazy names that give you the story of the entire supply chain, just one example:\n
Docomo Fujitsu Arrows V Nvidia Tegra 3 Phone\n\n

        Several devices by Xiaomi\n\n

In Argentina, phones are generally extremely expensive because of the high import duties placed on them. These duties can easily increase the price of a phone to over 50% more than in the US. Some of the more savvy get round this by ordering individual phones direct from China and declaring the value incorrectly. While we do not advocate this,  it does mean that you see some models in Argentina that you might not see else where. During my last trip  I got to have a quick play with a Xiaomi and was extremely impressed, the build quality was good and the phone seemed very zippy. And that was before I knew that many of the Xiaomi devices are rocking thermometers. Check out the MI 2 and MI 2S, in addition the default MIUI is pretty nice and supports many languages.\n\n

        Snopow M6\n\n

Waterproof, anti-shock, thermometer … all for $250. This looks tasty, but we\’ve never actually tried one, if you have let us know whether it really is as good as it sounds. Find it here. In particular we don\’t know if the temperature readings are available through the Android APIs, they should be, but as we have no instances of this phone in our database we can\’t be sure. If you have one, download WeatherSignal, and then shoot us an email via the contact form.\n\n

Casio Gz1 Commando (aka G’zOne Commando)\n\n

The name of this phone gives you a good idea of what it\’s all about, it\’s a rugged gadget, rather like the Snopow. One of the first phones with a thermometer in the US, this is the sort of phone I would have wanted when I was 5, except phones didn\’t have thermometers then and I wouldn\’t have been allowed one even if they did.\n\n</item>

    <string-array name="pressure_descriptions">
        <item>A pressure sensor is a device for pressure measurement of gases or liquids. Pressure is an expression of the force required to stop a fluid from expanding, and is usually stated in terms of force per unit area. A pressure sensor usually acts as a transducer; it generates a signal as a function of the pressure imposed. For the purposes of this article, such a signal is electrical.\n\n

Pressure sensors are used for control and monitoring in thousands of everyday applications. Pressure sensors can also be used to indirectly measure other variables such as fluid/gas flow, speed, water level, and altitude. Pressure sensors can alternatively be called pressure transducers, pressure transmitters, pressure senders, pressure indicators, piezometers and manometers, among other names.\n\n

Pressure sensors can vary drastically in technology, design, performance, application suitability and cost. A conservative estimate would be that there may be over 50 technologies and at least 300 companies making pressure sensors worldwide.\n\n

There is also a category of pressure sensors that are designed to measure in a dynamic mode for capturing very high speed changes in pressure. Example applications for this type of sensor would be in the measuring of combustion pressure in an engine cylinder or in a gas turbine. These sensors are commonly manufactured out of piezoelectric materials such as quartz.\n\n

Some pressure sensors are pressure switches, which turn on or off at a particular pressure. For example, a water pump can be controlled by a pressure switch so that it starts when water is released from the system, reducing the pressure in a reservoir.\n\n</item>
        <item>Absolute pressure sensor\n\n
This sensor measures the pressure relative to perfect vacuum.\n\n

Gauge pressure sensor\n\n
This sensor measures the pressure relative to atmospheric pressure. A tire pressure gauge is an example of gauge pressure measurement; when it indicates zero, then the pressure it is measuring is the same as the ambient pressure.\n\n

Vacuum pressure sensor\n\n
This term can cause confusion. It may be used to describe a sensor that measures pressures below atmospheric pressure, showing the difference between that low pressure and atmospheric pressure, but it may also be used to describe a sensor that measures absolute pressure relative to a vacuum.\n\n

Differential pressure sensor\n\n
This sensor measures the difference between two pressures, one connected to each side of the sensor. Differential pressure sensors are used to measure many properties, such as pressure drops across oil filters or air filters, fluid levels (by comparing the pressure above and below the liquid) or flow rates (by measuring the change in pressure across a restriction). Technically speaking, most pressure sensors are really differential pressure sensors; for example a gauge pressure sensor is merely a differential pressure sensor in which one side is open to the ambient atmosphere.\n\n

Sealed pressure sensor\n\n
This sensor is similar to a gauge pressure sensor except that it measures pressure relative to some fixed pressure rather than the ambient atmospheric pressure (which varies according to the location and the weather).\n\n</item>
        <item>Piezoresistive strain gauge\n\n
Uses the piezoresistive effect of bonded or formed strain gauges to detect strain due to applied pressure, resistance increasing as pressure deforms the material. Common technology types are Silicon (Monocrystalline), Polysilicon Thin Film, Bonded Metal Foil, Thick Film, Silicon-on-Sapphire and Sputtered Thin Film. Generally, the strain gauges are connected to form a Wheatstone bridge circuit to maximize the output of the sensor and to reduce sensitivity to errors. This is the most commonly employed sensing technology for general purpose pressure measurement.\n\n

Capacitive\n\n
Uses a diaphragm and pressure cavity to create a variable capacitor to detect strain due to applied pressure, capacitance decreasing as pressure deforms the diaphragm. Common technologies use metal, ceramic, and silicon diaphragms.\n\n

Electromagnetic\n\n
Measures the displacement of a diaphragm by means of changes in inductance (reluctance), LVDT, Hall Effect, or by eddy current principle.\n\n

Piezoelectric\n\n
Uses the piezoelectric effect in certain materials such as quartz to measure the strain upon the sensing mechanism due to pressure. This technology is commonly employed for the measurement of highly dynamic pressures.\n\n

Strain-Gauge\n\n
Strain gauge based pressure sensors also use a pressure sensitive element where metal strain gauges are glued on or thin film gauges are applied on by sputtering. This measuring element can either be a diaphragm or for metal foil gauges measuring bodies in can-type can also be used. The big advantages of this monolithic can-type design are an improved rigidity and the capability to measure highest pressures of up to 15,000 bar. The electrical connection is normally done via a Wheatstone bridge which allows for a good amplification of the signal and precise and constant measuring results.\n\n

Optical\n\n
Techniques include the use of the physical change of an optical fiber to detect strain due to applied pressure. A common example of this type utilizes Fiber Bragg Gratings. This technology is employed in challenging applications where the measurement may be highly remote, under high temperature, or may benefit from technologies inherently immune to electromagnetic interference. Another analogous technique utilizes an elastic film constructed in layers that can change reflected wavelengths according to the applied pressure (strain).\n\n

Potentiometric\n\n
Uses the motion of a wiper along a resistive mechanism to detect the strain caused by applied pressure.\n\n

Other types\n\n

These types of electronic pressure sensors use other properties (such as density) to infer pressure of a gas, or liquid.\n\n

Resonant\n\n
Uses the changes in resonant frequency in a sensing mechanism to measure stress, or changes in gas density, caused by applied pressure. This technology may be used in conjunction with a force collector, such as those in the category above. Alternatively, resonant technology may be employed by exposing the resonating element itself to the media, whereby the resonant frequency is dependent upon the density of the media. Sensors have been made out of vibrating wire, vibrating cylinders, quartz, and silicon MEMS. Generally, this technology is considered to provide very stable readings over time.\n\n

Thermal\n\n
Uses the changes in thermal conductivity of a gas due to density changes to measure pressure. A common example of this type is the Pirani gauge.

Ionization\n\n
Measures the flow of charged gas particles (ions) which varies due to density changes to measure pressure. Common examples are the Hot and Cold Cathode gauges.\n\n</item>
        <item>Pressure sensing\n\n
This is where the measurement of interest is pressure, expressed as a force per unit area. This is useful in weather instrumentation, aircraft, automobiles, and any other machinery that has pressure functionality implemented.\n\n

Altitude sensing\n\n
This is useful in aircraft, rockets, satellites, weather balloons, and many other applications. All these applications make use of the relationship between changes in pressure relative to the altitude. This relationship is governed by the following equation:\n\n

Barometric pressure sensors can have an altitude resolution of less than 1 meter, which is significantly better than GPS systems (about 20 meters altitude resolution). In navigation applications altimeters are used to distinguish between stacked road levels for car navigation and floor levels in buildings for pedestrian navigation.\n\n

Flow sensing\n\n
This is the use of pressure sensors in conjunction with the venturi effect to measure flow. Differential pressure is measured between two segments of a venturi tube that have a different aperture. The pressure difference between the two segments is directly proportional to the flow rate through the venturi tube. A low pressure sensor is almost always required as the pressure difference is relatively small.\n\n

Level / depth sensing\n\n
A pressure sensor may also be used to calculate the level of a fluid. This technique is commonly employed to measure the depth of a submerged body (such as a diver or submarine), or level of contents in a tank (such as in a water tower). For most practical purposes, fluid level is directly proportional to pressure. In the case of fresh water where the contents are under atmospheric pressure, 1psi = 27.7 inH20 / 1Pa = 9.81 mmH20.\n\n

Leak testing\n\n
A pressure sensor may be used to sense the decay of pressure due to a system leak. This is commonly done by either comparison to a known leak using differential pressure, or by means of utilizing the pressure sensor to measure pressure change over time.\n\n</item>
        <item> Pressure sensors have several limitations that restrict their use in several areas. High temperature dependency, hysteresis, inability to deduce quick and dynamic pressure variations, sensitivity to the external vibrations, irreparability of the electronic board assembly, sensitivity to electric, magnetic and RF fields, incompatibilities with external devices are few challenges that a general pressure sensor faces.\n\n

            In some applications, pressure sensors have limited accuracy. For example, in a touch screen, the sensitivity of the sensor when multiple touches are made is affected while in the aviation sector high pressure can limit the working of the sensor.\n\n

Pressure sensors are essentially required to make a device respond to its ambient conditions in an optimized manner. Their types and uses are plenty and will continue to evolve as the sensor technology continues to mature.\n\n

            Extensive use of pressure sensors such as in touch screens or automobiles degrades their efficiency quite soon and hence the ruggedness of the pressure sensors is also a growing priority of industrial research. Nevertheless, pressure sensors tools, and as it goes with every other tool, these are to be used carefully as well as checked constantly to ensure quality results.\n\n</item>

        <item>Relative humidity (RH) is the ratio of the partial pressure of water vapor to the equilibrium vapor pressure of water at a given temperature.\n\n

            Relative humidity depends on temperature and the pressure of the system of interest. It requires less water vapor to attain high relative humidity at low temperatures; more water vapor is required to attain high relative humidity in warm or hot air.\n\n</item>
        <item>Humidity measurement in industries is critical because it may affect the business cost of the product and the health and safety of the personnel. Hence, humidity sensing is very important, especially in the control systems for industrial processes and human comfort.\n\n

Controlling or monitoring humidity is of paramount importance in many industrial &amp; domestic applications. In semiconductor industry, humidity or moisture levels needs to be properly controlled &amp; monitored during wafer processing.\n\n

            In medical applications, humidity control is required for respiratory equipments, sterilizers, incubators, pharmaceutical processing, and biological products. Humidity control is also necessary in chemical gas purification, dryers, ovens, film desiccation, paper and textile production, and food processing.\n\n

            In agriculture, measurement of humidity is important for plantation protection (dew prevention), soil moisture monitoring, etc. For domestic applications, humidity control is required for living environment in buildings, cooking control for microwave ovens, etc.  In all such applications and many others, humidity sensors are employed to provide an indication of the moisture levels in the environment.\n\n</item>
        <item>Humidity measurement can be done using dry and wet bulb hygrometers, dew point hygrometers, and electronic hygrometers. There has been a surge in the demand of electronic hygrometers, often called humidity sensors.\n\n

Electronic type hygrometers or humidity sensors can be broadly divided into two categories: one employs capacitive sensing principle, while other use resistive effects.\n\n</item>
        <item>Humidity sensors relying on this principle consists of a hygroscopic dielectric material sandwiched between a pair of electrodes forming a small capacitor. Most capacitive sensors use a plastic or polymer as the dielectric material, with a typical dielectric constant ranging from 2 to 15. In absence of moisture, the dielectric constant of the hygroscopic dielectric material and the sensor geometry determine the value of capacitance.\n\n

At normal room temperature, the dielectric constant of water vapor has a value of about 80, a value much larger than the constant of the sensor dielectric material. Therefore, absorption of water vapor by the sensor results in an increase in sensor capacitance.\n\n

At equilibrium conditions, the amount of moisture present in a hygroscopic material depends on both the ambient temperature and the ambient water vapor pressure. This is true also for the hygroscopic dielectric material used on the sensor.\n\n

By definition, relative humidity is a function of both the ambient temperature and water vapor pressure. Therefore there is a relationship between relative humidity, the amount of moisture present in the sensor, and sensor capacitance. This relationship governs the operation of a capacitive humidity instrument.\n\n</item>
        <item>Resistive type humidity sensors pick up changes in the resistance value of the sensor element in response to the change in the humidity.\n\n

        Thick film conductor of precious metals like gold, ruthenium oxide is printed and calcinated in the shape of the comb to form an electrode. Then a polymeric film is applied on the electrode; the film acts as a humidity sensing film due to the existence of movable ions. Change in impedance occurs due to the change in the number of movable ions.\n\n</item>

    <string-array name="heart_rate_ecg_descriptions">
        <item>A heart rate monitor is a personal monitoring device that allows one to measure one\'s heart rate in real time or record the heart rate for later study.\n\n

            It is largely used by performers of various types of physical exercise. In recent years, it has been common for smartwatches to include heart rate monitors, which has greatly increased popularity.\n\n</item>
        <item>Traditional heart rate monitors usually comprise two elements: a transmitter, worn on a chest strap, and a receiver. In early transmitters, water or liquid was required to get good conduction. In old versions, when a heart beat is detected a radio signal is transmitted, which the receiver uses to determine the current heart rate. This signal can be a simple radio pulse or a unique coded signal from the chest strap (such as Bluetooth, ANT, or other low-power radio link); the latter prevents one user\'s receiver from using signals from other nearby transmitters (known as cross-talk interference).\n\n

More recent devices use optics to measure heart rate by which measures changes in blood flow by shining a light from an LED through the skin and measuring how it scatters off blood vessels. In addition to measuring the heart rate, devices using this technology are able to measure blood oxygen saturation (SpO2). Newer devices include a microprocessor, which simultaneously monitors heart rate, oxygen saturation, and other parameters. These may include sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and GPS to detect speed, location and distance eliminating the need for ankle worn devices.\n\n</item>
        <item>Optical heart rate sensors work via pulse oximetry, a measurement technique that takes advantage of the fact that oxygenated and de-oxygenated hemoglobin have different optical properties.  With every heartbeat, there is a spike in arterial (oxygenated) blood, which is detected as a change in the absorbance and/or reflectance of red and/or infrared light.\n\n

        Optical heart rate sensor on Samsung phones is located under or next to the camera.  From left to right, the elements in the rectangular portion are the flash (not used for heart rate measurement), the optical detector, and a red LED.\n\n

Most optical heart rate monitors in smartphones or wearable devices are fairly rudimentary as compared to clinical oximeters.  They consist of a red LED and an optical detector which measures the reflectance of the red light from your skin (or more specifically, the blood under your skin).  The reflectance is a bit different during a heartbeat versus between heartbeats, so the detector will see a periodic signal for the duration of the measurement from which the heart rate is extracted.\n\n

        The same principle can be used to measure blood oxygenation, and many heart rate monitors in wearables claim to do this too.  However, one really needs to measure at two wavelengths to get the relative concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin.\n\n</item>
        <item>Knowing your heart rate can be useful because it helps you determine whether your exercise is intense enough to provide health benefits, but not so intense that it could present physical complications.\n\n

            Doctors do not typically recommend that individuals track only their heart rates, but what they eat, drink, and how much rest is needed to recover after any physical activity. Heart rate monitors can be great tools for getting interested in your health, but you should always start by speaking with your doctor before beginning any exercise regimen.\n\n

        The accuracy of the information and data provided by this device and its related software, including heart rate readings, may be affected by factors such as environmental conditions, skin condition, specific activity performed while using/wearing the device, settings of the device, user configuration, user-provided information, placement of the sensor on the body, and other end-user interactions. Please refer to the user manual for more information on proper wear and use.\n\n</item>
        <item>Heart rate monitors or activity trackers cannot tell you if you are fit for any physical activity. Only your doctor can tell you that. Your doctor should be able to assess your current health, and help you create an exercise program that’s right for you. While the heart rate sensor on your device can be a useful tool for motivating you and tracking your exercise intensity, the heart rate sensor and compatible Samsung Health application are not medical devices and are not intended to diagnose, treat or prevent a disease or medical condition.\n\n

Some applications or prolonged usage may increase device temperature. Prolonged skin contact with a device that is hot to the touch may produce skin discomfort or redness, or low-temperature burns. If the device feels hot to the touch, discontinue use and close all applications or turn off the device until it cools. Always ensure that the device has adequate ventilation and air flow. Covering the device with bedding, your body, thick clothing or any other materials that significantly affect air flow may affect the performance of the device and poses a possible risk of fire or explosion, which could lead to serious bodily injuries or damage to property.\n\n</item>

    <string-array name="midi_descriptions">
        <item>MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a protocol designed for recording and playing back music on digital synthesizers that is supported by many makes of personal computer sound cards. Originally intended to control one keyboard from another, it was quickly adopted for the personal computer. Rather than representing musical sound directly, it transmits information about how music is produced. The command set includes note-ons, note-offs, key velocity, pitch bend and other methods of controlling a synthesizer. The sound waves produced are those already stored in a wavetable in the receiving instrument or sound card.\n\n


Since a MIDI file only represents player information, it is far more concise than formats that the sound directly. An advantage is very small file size. A disadvantage is the lack of specific sound control.\n\n

With a program that provides this interface, you can create music using a standard keyboard or other input device. You or others can then play your MIDI-conforming creation with the same or another program and a sound card as a music synthesizer. The MIDI program may come with a graphical user interface that looks like a sound studio control room. Many sound cards come as a package with MIDI software (for example, Media Vision\'s Pro Audio Studio 16).\n\n

The MIDI protocol uses eight-bit serial transmission with one start bit and one stop bit, has a 31.25 Kbs data rate, and is asynchronous. Connection is made through a five-pin DIN plug, of which three pins are used.</item>
        <item>Instrument control\n\n

MIDI was invented so that electronic or digital musical instruments could communicate with each other and so that one instrument can control another. For example, a MIDI-compatible sequencer can trigger beats produced by a drum sound module. \n\n

            Analog synthesizers that have no digital component and were built prior to MIDI\'s development can be retrofit with kits that convert MIDI messages into analog control voltages. When a note is played on a MIDI instrument, it generates a digital signal that can be used to trigger a note on another instrument.\n\n

            The capability for remote control allows full-sized instruments to be replaced with smaller sound modules, and allows musicians to combine instruments to achieve a fuller sound, or to create combinations of synthesized instrument sounds, such as acoustic piano and strings. MIDI also enables other instrument parameters (volume, effects, etc.) to be controlled remotely.\n\n

        Composition\n\n

        MIDI events can be sequenced with computer software, or in specialized hardware music workstations. Many digital audio workstations (DAWs) are specifically designed to work with MIDI as an integral component. MIDI piano rolls have been developed in many DAWs so that the recorded MIDI messages can be extensively modified. These tools allow composers to audition and edit their work much more quickly and efficiently than did older solutions, such as multitrack recording.\n\n</item>
        <item>A computer MIDI interface\'s main function is to match clock speeds between the MIDI device and the computer. Some computer sound cards include a standard MIDI connector, whereas others connect by any of various means that include the D-subminiature DA-15 game port, USB, FireWire, Ethernet or a proprietary connection.\n\n

            The increasing use of USB connectors in the 2000s has led to the availability of MIDI-to-USB data interfaces that can transfer MIDI channels to USB-equipped computers. Some MIDI keyboard controllers are equipped with USB jacks, and can be plugged into computers that run music software.\n\n

MIDI\'s serial transmission leads to timing problems. A three-byte MIDI message requires nearly 1 millisecond for transmission. Because MIDI is serial, it can only send one event at a time. If an event is sent on two channels at once, the event on the higher-numbered channel cannot transmit until the first one is finished, and so is delayed by 1ms. If an event is sent on all channels at the same time, the highest-numbered channel\'s transmission is delayed by as much as 16ms.\n\n

            This contributed to the rise of MIDI interfaces with multiple in- and out-ports, because timing improves when events are spread between multiple ports as opposed to multiple channels on the same port. The term \"MIDI slop\" refers to audible timing errors that result when MIDI transmission is delayed.\n\n</item>

        <item>Virtual reality (VR) is an interactive computer-generated experience taking place within a simulated environment, that incorporates mainly auditory and visual, but also other types of sensory feedback like haptic.\n\n

            This immersive environment can be similar to the real world or it can be fantastical, creating an experience that is not possible in ordinary physical reality. Augmented reality systems may also be considered a form of VR that layers virtual information over a live camera feed into a headset or through a smartphone or tablet device giving the user the ability to view three-dimensional images.\n\n

Current VR technology most commonly uses virtual reality headsets or multi-projected environments, sometimes in combination with physical environments or props, to generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulate a user\'s physical presence in a virtual or imaginary environment.\n\n

            A person using virtual reality equipment is able to \"look around\" the artificial world, move around in it, and interact with virtual features or items. The effect is commonly created by VR headsets consisting of a head-mounted display with a small screen in front of the eyes, but can also be created through specially designed rooms with multiple large screens.\n\n</item>
        <item>\"Virtual\" has had the meaning of \"being something in essence or effect, though not actually or in fact\" since the mid-1400s. The term \"virtual\" has been used in the computer sense of \"not physically existing but made to appear by software\" since 1959.[1] In 1938, Antonin Artaud described the illusory nature of characters and objects in the theatre as \"la réalité virtuelle\" in a collection of essays, Le Théâtre et son double. The English translation of this book, published in 1958 as The Theater and its Double, is the earliest published use of the term \"virtual reality\". The term \"artificial reality\", coined by Myron Krueger, has been in use since the 1970s. The term \"virtual reality\" was first used in a science fiction context in The Judas Mandala, a 1982 novel by Damien Broderick.\n\n

A \"cyberspace\" is a networked virtual reality.\n\n

Virtual reality shares some elements with \"augmented reality\" (or AR). AR is a type of virtual reality technology that blends what the user sees in their real surroundings with digital content generated by computer software. The additional software-generated images with the virtual scene typically enhance how the real surroundings look in some way. Some AR systems use a camera to capture the user\'s surroundings or some type of display screen which the user looks at (e.g., Microsoft\'s HoloLens, Magic Leap).\n\n</item>
        <item>The Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML), first introduced in 1994, was intended for the development of \"virtual worlds\" without dependency on headsets. The Web3D consortium was subsequently founded in 1997 for the development of industry standards for web-based 3D graphics. The consortium subsequently developed X3D from the VRML framework as an archival, open-source standard for web-based distribution of VR content.\n\n

All modern VR displays are based on technology developed for smartphones including: gyroscopes and motion sensors for tracking head, hand, and body positions; small HD screens for stereoscopic displays; and small, lightweight and fast processors. These components led to relative affordability for independent VR developers, and lead to the 2012 Oculus Rift Kickstarter offering the first independently developed VR headset.\n\n

Independent production of VR images and video has increased by the development of omnidirectional cameras, also known as 360-degree cameras or VR cameras, that have the ability to record in all directions, although at low-resolutions or in highly compressed formats for online streaming of 360 video. In contrast, photogrammetry is increasingly used to combine several high-resolution photographs for the creation of detailed 3D objects and environments in VR applications.\n\n</item>
        <item>VR is most commonly used in entertainment applications such as gaming and 3D cinema. Consumer virtual reality headsets were first released by video game companies in the early-mid 1990\'s. Beginning in the 2010\'s, next-generation commercial tethered headsets were released by Oculus, the HTC Vive and PlayStation VR, setting off a new wave of application development.\n\

3D cinema has been used for sporting events, pornography, fine art, music videos and short films. Since 2015, virtual reality has been installed onto a number of roller coasters and theme parks.\n\n

In robotics, virtual reality has been used to control robots in telepresence and telerobotic systems.\n\n

In social sciences and psychology, virtual reality offers a cost-effective tool to study and replicate interactions in a controlled environment.\n\n

        Surgery training can be done through virtual reality.[citation needed] Other medical uses include virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET), a form of exposure therapy for treating anxiety disorders such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and phobias.\n\n

VR can simulate real workspaces for workplace occupational safety and health purposes, educational purposes, and training purposes. It can be used to provide learners with a virtual environment where they can develop their skills without the real-world consequences of failing. It has been used and studied in primary education, military, astronaut training, flight simulators and driver training.\n\n</item>

By being able to detect a face in the scene, the camera can concentrate its autofocus on that person\’s face to ensure it is the primary subject in focus within the image. More sophisticated implementations can also link up to scene-recognition algorithms and optimise the exposure for the subject\’s face.\n\n

Once a face has been detected, the system will track that face as best it can. If the person turns away, detection lock will be lost, though some camera manufacturers have enhanced the detection capability to maintain a lock even when the subject has turned to the extent that only one eye remains visible. Some face detection modes can lock onto several faces at once, in which case the face that is used as the primary subject of focus will usually be based on which is closest or most prominent, though sometimes you can override this by selecting a face manually. If several faces are detected at once, not all of them will necessarily be in focus.\n\n</item>
        <item>Face recognition is an enhanced form of face detection. Instead of simply letting the camera recognise any face in the crowd, you can configure the camera to recognise a particular person\’s face and use this as the focal point. To do this, you simply take a portrait shot of the person you want the camera to recognise and save it in the recognition system\’s memory.\n\n
            You can usually program in several identities at once. Some camera manufacturers are even starting to supply software that reads the embedded identity data saved in the image file. This could be a useful tool when searching images for a particular person who was recognised by the camera at the time the picture was taken.\n\n</item>
        <item>While the process is somewhat complex, face detection algorithms often begin by searching for human eyes. Eyes constitute what is known as a valley region and are one of the easiest features to detect. Once eyes are detected, the algorithm might then attempt to detect facial regions including eyebrows, the mouth, nose, nostrils and the iris. Once the algorithm surmises that it has detected a facial region, it can then apply additional tests to validate whether it has, in fact, detected a face.\n\n</item>
        <item>One of the most important applications of face detection, however, is facial recognition. Face recognition describes a biometric technology that goes way beyond recognizing when a human face is present. It actually attempts to establish whose face it is. The process works using a computer application that captures a digital image of an individual\’s face (sometimes taken from a video frame) and compares it to images in a database of stored records. While facial recognition isn\’t 100% accurate, it can very accurately determine when there is a strong chance that an person’s face matches someone in the database.\n\n

There are lots of applications of face recognition. Face recognition is already being used to unlock phones and specific applications. Face recognition is also used for biometric surveillance. Banks, retail stores, stadiums, airports and other facilities use facial recognition to reduce crime and prevent violence.\n\n

So in short, while all facial recognition systems use face detection, not all face detection systems have a facial recognition component.\n\n</item>

    </string-array>

    <string-array name="barcode_reader_descriptions">
        <item>A bar code reader (or bar code scanner) is an electronic device that can read and output printed barcodes to a computer. Like a flatbed scanner, it consists of a light source, a lens and a light sensor translating optical impulses into electrical ones. Additionally, nearly all barcode readers contain decoder circuitry analyzing the bar code\'s image data provided by the sensor and sending the barcode\'s content to the scanner\'s output port.\n\n</item>
        <item>Laser scanners work the same way as pen type readers except that they use a laser beam as the light source and typically employ either a reciprocating mirror or a rotating prism to scan the laser beam back and forth across the bar code. As with the pen type reader, a photo-diode is used to measure the intensity of the light reflected back from the bar code. In both pen readers and laser scanners, the light emitted by the reader is rapidly varied in brightness with a data pattern and the photo-diode receive circuitry is designed to detect only signals with the same modulated pattern.\n\n</item>
        <item>CCD readers use an array of hundreds of tiny light sensors lined up in a row in the head of the reader. Each sensor measures the intensity of the light immediately in front of it. Each individual light sensor in the CCD reader is extremely small and because there are hundreds of sensors lined up in a row, a voltage pattern identical to the pattern in a bar code is generated in the reader by sequentially measuring the voltages across each sensor in the row. The important difference between a CCD reader and a pen or laser scanner is that the CCD reader is measuring emitted ambient light from the bar code whereas pen or laser scanners are measuring reflected light of a specific frequency originating from the scanner itself.\n\n</item>
        <item>Two-dimensional imaging scanners are a newer type of bar code reader. They use a camera and image processing techniques to decode the bar code.\n\n

Video camera readers use small video cameras with the same CCD technology as in a CCD bar code reader except that instead of having a single row of sensors, a video camera has hundreds of rows of sensors arranged in a two dimensional array so that they can generate an image.\n\n

Large field-of-view readers use high resolution industrial cameras to capture multiple bar codes simultaneously. All the bar codes appearing in the photo are decoded instantly (ImageID patents and code creation tools) or by use of plugins (e.g. the Barcodepedia used a flash application and some web cam for querying a database), have been realized options for resolving the given tasks.\n\n</item>
        <item>The scanner resolution is measured by the size of the dot of light emitted by the reader. If this dot of light is wider than any bar or space in the bar code, then it will overlap two elements (two spaces or two bars) and it may produce wrong output. On the other hand, if a too small dot of light is used, then it can misinterpret any spot on the bar code making the final output wrong.\n\n

The most commonly used dimension is 13 thou (0.013 in or 0.33 mm), although some scanners can read codes with dimensions as small as 3 thou (0.003 in or 0.075 mm). Most manufacturers advertise bar code resolution in mil, which is interchangeable with thou. Smaller bar codes must be printed at high resolution to be read accurately.\n\n</item>
        <item>A barcode scanner usually consists of three different parts including the illumination system, the sensor, and the decoder.\n\n

In general, a barcode scanner \“scans\” the black and white elements of a barcode by illuminating the code with a red light, which is then converted into matching text. More specifically, the sensor in the barcode scanner detects the reflected light from the illumination system (the red light) and generates an analog signal that is sent to the decoder. The decoder interprets that signal, validates the barcode using the check digit, and converts it into text.\n\n

This converted text is delivered by the scanner to a computer software system holding a database of the maker, cost, and quantity of all products sold. This video is a quick lesson in barcode scanners and highlights the basic differences between a Contact Scanner, Laser Scanner, and an Imager.\n\n</item>

    <string-array name="text_scan_descriptions">
        <item>Optical character recognition (also optical character reader, OCR) is the mechanical or electronic conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo (for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo) or from subtitle text superimposed on an image (for example from a television broadcast).\n\n

Widely used as a form of information entry from printed paper data records – whether passport documents, invoices, bank statements, computerised receipts, business cards, mail, printouts of static-data, or any suitable documentation – it is a common method of digitising printed texts so that they can be electronically edited, searched, stored more compactly, displayed on-line, and used in machine processes such as cognitive computing, machine translation, (extracted) text-to-speech, key data and text mining. OCR is a field of research in pattern recognition, artificial intelligence and computer vision.\n\n</item>
        <item>Early optical character recognition may be traced to technologies involving telegraphy and creating reading devices for the blind. In 1914, Emanuel Goldberg developed a machine that read characters and converted them into standard telegraph code. Concurrently, Edmund Fournier d\'Albe developed the Optophone, a handheld scanner that when moved across a printed page, produced tones that corresponded to specific letters or characters.\n\n

In the late 1920s and into the 1930s Emanuel Goldberg developed what he called a \"Statistical Machine\" for searching microfilm archives using an optical code recognition system. In 1931 he was granted USA Patent number 1,838,389 for the invention. The patent was acquired by IBM.\n\n

With the advent of smart-phones and smartglasses, OCR can be used in internet connected mobile device applications that extract text captured using the device\'s camera. These devices that do not have OCR functionality built into the operating system will typically use an OCR API to extract the text from the image file captured and provided by the device. The OCR API returns the extracted text, along with information about the location of the detected text in the original image back to the device app for further processing (such as text-to-speech) or display.\n\n</item>
        <item>Data entry for business documents, e.g. check, passport, invoice, bank statement and receipt\n\n
Automatic number plate recognition\n\n
In airports, for passport recognition and information extraction\n\n
Automatic insurance documents key information extraction\n\n
Extracting business card information into a contact list\n\n
More quickly make textual versions of printed documents, e.g. book scanning for Project Gutenberg\n\n
Make electronic images of printed documents searchable, e.g. Google Books\n\n
Converting handwriting in real time to control a computer (pen computing)\n\n
Defeating CAPTCHA anti-bot systems, though these are specifically designed to prevent OCR. The purpose can also be to test the robustness of CAPTCHA anti-bot systems.\n\n
Assistive technology for blind and visually impaired users\n\n</item>
        <item>Optical character recognition (OCR) – targets typewritten text, one glyph or character at a time.
Optical word recognition – targets typewritten text, one word at a time (for languages that use a space as a word divider). (Usually just called \"OCR\".)\n\n
Intelligent character recognition (ICR) – also targets handwritten printscript or cursive text one glyph or character at a time, usually involving machine learning.\n\n
Intelligent word recognition (IWR) – also targets handwritten printscript or cursive text, one word at a time. This is especially useful for languages where glyphs are not separated in cursive script.\n\n
OCR is generally an \"offline\" process, which analyses a static document. Handwriting movement analysis can be used as input to handwriting recognition. Instead of merely using the shapes of glyphs and words, this technique is able to capture motions, such as the order in which segments are drawn, the direction, and the pattern of putting the pen down and lifting it. This additional information can make the end-to-end process more accurate. This technology is also known as \"on-line character recognition\", \"dynamic character recognition\", \"real-time character recognition\", and \"intelligent character recognition\".\n\n</item>

        <item>Image recognition, in the context of machine vision, is the ability of software to identify objects, places, people, writing and actions in images. Computers can use machine vision technologies in combination with a camera and artificial intelligence software to achieve image recognition.\n\n

Image recognition is used to perform a large number of machine-based visual tasks, such as labeling the content of images with meta-tags, performing image content search and guiding autonomous robots, self-driving cars and accident avoidance systems.\n\n

While human and animal brains recognize objects with ease, computers have difficulty with the task. Software for image recognition requires deep machine learning. Performance is best on convolutional neural net processors as the specific task otherwise requires massive amounts of power for its compute-intensive nature. Image recognition algorithms can function by use of comparative 3D models, appearances from different angles using edge detection or by components. Image recognition algorithms are often trained on millions of pre-labeled pictures with guided computer learning.\n\n</item>
        <item>Current and future applications of image recognition include smart photo libraries, targeted advertising, the interactivity of media, accessibility for the visually impaired and enhanced research capabilities. Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple and Pinterest are among the many companies that are investing significant resources and research into image recognition and related applications. Privacy concerns over image recognition and similar technologies are controversial as these companies can pull a large volume of data from user photos uploaded to their social media platforms.\n\n</item>
        <item>The image recognition market is estimated to grow from USD 15.95 Billion in 2016 to USD 38.92 Billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 19.5% between 2016 and 2021. Advancements in machine learning and use of high bandwidth data services is fueling the growth of this technology. Companies in different sectors such as e-commerce, automotive, healthcare, and gaming are rapidly adopting image recognition. According to the report by MarketsandMarkets, the image recognition market is divided into hardware, software, and services. The hardware segment dominated by smartphones and scanners can play a huge role in the growth of image recognition market. There is an increasing need for security applications and products with innovative technologies such as surveillance cameras and face recognition.\n\n

Image recognition refers to technologies that identify places, logos, people, objects, buildings, and several other variables in images. Users are sharing vast amounts of data through apps, social networks, and websites. Additionally, mobile phones equipped with cameras are leading to the creation of limitless digital images and videos. The large volume of digital data is being used by companies to deliver better and smarter services to the people accessing it.\n\n

Image recognition is a part of computer vision and a process to identify and detect an object or attribute in a digital video or image. Computer vision is a broader term which includes methods of gathering, processing and analyzing data from the real world. The data is high-dimensional and produces numerical or symbolic information in the form of decisions. Apart from image recognition, computer vision also includes event detection, object recognition, learning, image reconstruction and video tracking.\n\n</item>
        <item>Facebook can now perform face recognize at 98% accuracy which is comparable to the ability of humans. Facebook can identify your friend\’s face with only a few tagged pictures. The efficacy of this technology depends on the ability to classify images. Classification is pattern matching with data. Images are data in the form of 2-dimensional matrices. In fact, image recognition is classifying data into one category out of many. One common and an important example is optical character recognition (OCR). OCR converts images of typed or handwritten text into machine-encoded text.\n\n

The major steps in image recognition process are gather and organize data, build a predictive model and use it to recognize images.\n\n

The human eye perceives an image as a set of signals which are processed by the visual cortex in the brain. This results in a vivid experience of a scene, associated with concepts and objects recorded in one\’s memory. Image recognition tries to mimic this process. Computer perceives an image as either a raster or a vector image. Raster images are a sequence of pixels with discrete numerical values for colors while vector images are a set of color-annotated polygons.\n\n</item>

    <string-array name="fake_touch_descriptions">
        <item>A touchpad or trackpad is a pointing device featuring a tactile sensor, a specialized surface that can translate the motion and position of a user\'s fingers to a relative position on the operating system that is made output to the screen.\n\n

            Touchpads are a common feature of laptop computers, and are also used as a substitute for a mouse where desk space is scarce. Because they vary in size, they can also be found on personal digital assistants (PDAs) and some portable media players. Wireless touchpads are also available as detached accessories.\n\n</item>
        <item>Touchpads operate in one of several ways, including capacitive sensing and resistive touchscreen. The most common technology used in the 2010s senses the change of capacitance where a finger touches the pad. Capacitance-based touchpads will not sense the tip of a pencil or other similar ungrounded or non-conducting implement. Fingers insulated by a glove may also be problematic.\n\n

While touchpads, like touchscreens, are able to sense absolute position, resolution is limited by their size. For common use as a pointer device, the dragging motion of a finger is translated into a finer, relative motion of the cursor on the output to the display on the operating system, analogous to the handling of a mouse that is lifted and put back on a surface. Hardware buttons equivalent to a standard mouse\'s left and right buttons are positioned adjacent to the touchpad.\n\n

Some touchpads and associated device driver software may interpret tapping the pad as a mouse click, and a tap followed by a continuous pointing motion (a \"click-and-a-half\") can indicate dragging. Tactile touchpads allow for clicking and dragging by incorporating button functionality into the surface of the touchpad itself. To select, one presses down on the touchpad instead of a physical button. To drag, instead of performing the \"click-and-a-half\" technique, the user presses down while on the object, drags without releasing pressure, and lets go when done. Touchpad drivers can also allow the use of multiple fingers to emulate the other mouse buttons (commonly two-finger tapping for the center button).\n\n</item>
        <item>Touchpads are primarily used in self-contained portable laptop computers and do not require a flat surface near the machine. The touchpad is close to the keyboard, and only very short finger movements are required to move the cursor across the display screen; while advantageous, this also makes it possible for a user\'s palm or wrist to move the mouse cursor accidentally while typing. Touchpads also exist for desktop computers as an external peripheral, albeit rarely seen. Touchpads are sometimes integrated in some desktop computer keyboards, particularly keyboards oriented for HTPC use.\n\n

One-dimensional touchpads are the primary control interface for menu navigation on second-generation and later iPod Classic portable music players, where they are referred to as \"click wheels\", since they only sense motion along one axis, which is wrapped around like a wheel. Creative Labs also uses a touchpad for their Zen line of MP3 players, beginning with the Zen Touch. The second-generation Microsoft Zune product line (the Zune 80/120 and Zune 4/8) uses touch for the Zune Pad.\n\n

Apple\'s PowerBook 500 series was its first laptop to carry such a device, which Apple refers to as a \"trackpad\". When introduced in May 1994, it replaced the trackball of previous PowerBook models. In late 2008 Apple\'s revisions of the MacBook and MacBook Pro incorporated a \"Tactile Touchpad\" design with button functionality incorporated into the tracking surface. Beginning in the second generation of MacBook Pro, the entire touchpad surface acts as a clickable button.\n\n

Laptops today feature multitouch touchpads that can sense in some cases up to five fingers simultaneously, providing more options for input, such as the ability to bring up the context menu by tapping two fingers, dragging two fingers for scrolling, or gestures for zoom in/out or rotate.\n\n</item>
        <item>There are two principal means by which touchpads work. In the matrix approach, a series of conductors are arranged in an array of parallel lines in two layers, separated by an insulator and crossing each other at right angles to form a grid.\n\n

            A high frequency signal is applied sequentially between pairs in this two-dimensional grid array. The current that passes between the nodes is proportional to the capacitance. When a virtual ground, such as a finger, is placed over one of the intersections between the conductive layer some of the electrical field is shunted to this ground point, resulting in a change in the apparent capacitance at that location. This method received U.S. Patent 5,305,017 awarded to George Gerpheide in April 1994.\n\n

The capacitive shunt method, described in an application note by Analog Devices, senses the change in capacitance between a transmitter and receiver that are on opposite sides of the sensor. The transmitter creates an electric field which oscillates at 200–300 kHz. If a ground point, such as the finger, is placed between the transmitter and receiver, some of the field lines are shunted away, decreasing the apparent capacitance.\n\n</item>

    <string-array name="wifi_direct_descriptions">
        <item>Wi-Fi Direct, initially called Wi-Fi P2P, is a Wi-Fi standard enabling devices to easily connect with each other without requiring a wireless access point. Wi-Fi Direct allows two devices to establish a direct Wi-Fi connection without requiring a wireless router.\n\n

            Hence, Wi-Fi Direct is single radio hop communication, not multihop wireless communication, unlike wireless ad hoc networks and mobile ad hoc networks. Wi-Fi ad hoc mode, however, supports multi-hop radio communications, with intermediate Wi-Fi nodes as packet relays.\n\n

Wi-Fi becomes a way of communicating wirelessly, much like Bluetooth. It is useful for everything from internet browsing to file transfer, and to communicate with one or more devices simultaneously at typical Wi-Fi speeds. One advantage of Wi-Fi Direct is the ability to connect devices even if they are from different manufacturers. Only one of the Wi-Fi devices needs to be compliant with Wi-Fi Direct to establish a peer-to-peer connection that transfers data directly between them with greatly reduced setup.\n\n

Wi-Fi Direct negotiates the link with a Wi-Fi Protected Setup system that assigns each device a limited wireless access point. The \"pairing\" of Wi-Fi Direct devices can be set up to require the proximity of a near field communication, a Bluetooth signal, or a button press on one or all the devices.\n\n</item>
        <item>Conventional Wi-Fi networks are typically based on the presence of controller devices known as wireless access points. These devices normally combine three primary functions:\n\n

Physical support for wireless and wired networking.\n
Bridging and routing between devices on the network.\n
Service provisioning to add and remove devices from the network.\n\n

A typical Wi-Fi home network includes laptops, tablets and phones, devices like modern printers, music devices and televisions. The majority of Wi-Fi networks are set up in \"infrastructure mode\", where the access point acts as a central hub to which Wi-Fi capable devices are connected.\n\n

            The devices do not communicate directly with each other (that is, in \"ad-hoc mode\"), but they go through the access point. Wi-Fi Direct devices are able to communicate with each other without requiring a dedicated wireless access point. The Wi-Fi Direct devices negotiate when they first connect to determine which device shall act as an access point.\n\n</item>
        <item>With the increase in the number and type of devices attaching to Wi-Fi systems, the basic model of a simple router with smart computers became increasingly strained. At the same time, the increasing sophistication of the hot spots presented setup problems for the users. To address these problems, there have been numerous attempts to simplify certain aspects of the setup task.\n\n

A common example is the Wi-Fi Protected Setup system included in most access points built since 2007 when the standard was introduced.[6] Wi-Fi Protected Setup allows access points to be set up simply by entering a PIN or other identification into a connection screen, or in some cases, simply by pressing a button.\n\n

            The Protected Setup system uses this information to send data to a computer, handing it the information needed to complete the network setup and connect to the Internet. From the user\'s point of view, a single click replaces the multi-step, jargon-filled setup experience formerly required.\n\n

While the Protected Setup model works as intended, it was intended only to simplify the connection between the access point and the devices that would make use of its services, primarily accessing the Internet. It provides little help within a network - finding and setting up printer access from a computer for instance.\n\n

            To address those roles, a number of different protocols have developed, including Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), Devices Profile for Web Services (DPWS), and Zero Configuration Networking (ZeroConf). These protocols allow devices to seek out other devices within the network, query their capabilities, and provide some level of automatic setup.\n\n</item>
        <item>Wi-Fi Direct has become a standard feature in smart phones and portable media players, and in feature phones as well. The process of adding Wi-Fi to smaller devices has accelerated, and it is now possible to find printers, cameras, scanners and many other common devices with Wi-Fi in addition to other connections, like USB.\n\n

The widespread adoption of Wi-Fi in new classes of smaller devices made the need for ad hoc networking much more important. Even without a central Wi-Fi hub or router, it would be useful for a laptop computer to be able to wirelessly connect to a local printer. Although the ad hoc mode was created to address this sort of need, the lack of additional information for discovery makes it difficult to use in practice.\n\n

Although systems like UPnP and Bonjour provide many of the needed capabilities and are included in some devices, a single widely supported standard was lacking, and support within existing devices was far from universal. A guest using their smart phone would likely be able to find a hot spot and connect to the Internet with ease, perhaps using Protected Setup to do so. But the same device would find streaming music to a computer or printing a file might be difficult, or simply not supported between differing brands of hardware.\n\n

Wi-Fi Direct can provide a wireless connection to peripherals. Wireless mice, keyboards, remote controls, headsets, speakers, displays and many other functions can be implemented with Wi-Fi Direct. This has begun with Wi-Fi mouse products, and Wi-Fi Direct remote controls that were shipping circa November 2012.\n\n

File sharing applications on Android and BlackBerry 10 devices could use Wi-Fi Direct, with most Android Version 4.1 (Jellybean), introduced in July 2012, and BlackBerry 10.2 supported. Android version 4.2 (Jellybean) included further refinements to Wi-Fi Direct including persistent permissions enabling two-way transfer of data between multiple devices.\n\n

The Miracast standard for the wireless connection of devices to displays is based on Wi-Fi direct.\n\n</item>

    <string-array name="barometer_descriptions">
        <item>Wikipedia describes a barometer as \“a scientific instrument used in meteorology to measure atmospheric pressure.\”\n\n

            It measures the pressure exerted by the atmosphere above it. This measurement of pressure can be used to forecast short term changes in the weather and can be used to estimate altitude.\n\n</item>
        <item>HTC\’s Sense UI includes an iconic \“clock and weather\” widget prominently featured on the homescreen. Other app developers have created similar widgets, such as Beautiful Widgets, pictured below.\n\n

These widgets use your smartphone\’s geo-location information and your Internet connection to retrieve local weather information (current, high, and low temperatures; and current conditions) for various weather data providers. Using the same information you can get the weather forecast for the next several days.\n\n

Augmenting those with real-time, local, barometric pressure readings may allow these types of apps to be even more reactive to changes in the weather.\n\n</item>
        <item>A barometer is a passive sensor (rather than an \“active\” sensor, like GPS).\n\n

            An app could alert you to your altitude when you approach certain thresholds — without sucking down your battery like GPS does.\n\n

            Perhaps apps like My Tracks could be updated to include an \“altitude trigger\” option, which could turn on the GPS to record your location at 50-foot increments of elevation change, saving your batter, but still recording a relatively accurate track.\n\n</item>
        <item>Not just Samsung is using them, nearly every major smartphone vendor applies a barometer sensor on his premium devices.\n\n

The barometer is needed to measure relative altitude. That\'s a crucial information for positioning, especially indoor-positioning.\n\n

By combining GPS or Network-based positioning (X+Y coordinates) with Barometer-data (Z-axis) it\'s possible to determinate the location of the user in all 3 dimensions.\n\n

That\'s important for services like Google maps to show you useful information related to which floor of a building (i.e. Shopping mall, airport) you currently are.\n\n</item>

        <item>Device Roles</item>
        <item>USB Host Mode (Android) And The OTG Extension</item>
    </string-array>

    <string-array name="usb_accessory_descriptions">
        <item>USB On-The-Go, often abbreviated to USB OTG or just OTG, is a specification first used in late 2001 that allows USB devices, such as tablets or smartphones, to act as a host, allowing other USB devices, such as USB flash drives, digital cameras, mice or keyboards, to be attached to them.\n\n

            Use of USB OTG allows those devices to switch back and forth between the roles of host and device. A mobile phone may read from removable media as the host device, but present itself as a USB Mass Storage Device when connected to a host computer.\n\n

USB OTG introduces the concept of a device performing both master and slave roles – whenever two USB devices are connected and one of them is a USB OTG device, they establish a communication link. The device controlling the link is called the master or host, while the other is called the slave or peripheral.\n\n

USB OTG defines two roles for devices: OTG A-device and OTG B-device, specifying which side supplies power to the link, and which initially is the host. The OTG A-device is a power supplier, and an OTG B-device is a power consumer. In the default link configuration, the A-device acts as a USB host with the B-device acting as a USB peripheral. The host and peripheral modes may be exchanged later by using Host Negotiation Protocol (HNP).\n\n

The initial role of each device is defined by which mini plug a user inserts into its receptacle.\n\n</item>
        <item>Standard USB uses a master/slave architecture; a host acts as the master device for the entire bus, and a USB device acts as a slave. If implementing standard USB, devices must assume one role or the other, with computers generally set up as hosts, while (for example) printers normally function as slaves. In the absence of USB OTG, cell phones often implemented slave functionality to allow easy transfer of data to and from computers. Such phones, as slaves, could not readily be connected to printers as they also implemented the slave role. USB OTG directly addresses this issue.\n\n

When a device is plugged into the USB bus, the master device, or host, sets up communications with the device and handles service provisioning (the host\'s software enables or does the needed data-handling such as file managing or other desired kind of data communication or function). That allows the devices to be greatly simplified compared to the host; for example, a mouse contains very little logic and relies on the host to do almost all of the work. The host controls all data transfers over the bus, with the devices capable only of signalling (when polled) that they require attention. To transfer data between two devices, for example from a phone to a printer, the host first reads the data from one device, then writes it to the other.\n\n

While the master-slave arrangement works for some devices, many devices can act either as master or as slave depending on what else shares the bus. For instance, a computer printer is normally a slave device, but when a USB flash drive containing images is plugged into the printer\'s USB port with no computer present (or at least turned off), it would be useful for the printer to take on the role of host, allowing it to communicate with the flash drive directly and to print images from it.\n\n</item>
        <item>USB OTG defines two roles for devices: OTG A-device and OTG B-device, specifying which side supplies power to the link, and which initially is the host. The OTG A-device is a power supplier, and an OTG B-device is a power consumer. In the default link configuration, the A-device acts as a USB host with the B-device acting as a USB peripheral. The host and peripheral modes may be exchanged later by using HNP. Because every OTG controller supports both roles, they are often called \"Dual-Role\" controllers rather than \"OTG controllers\".\n\n

For integrated circuit (IC) designers, an attractive feature of USB OTG is the ability to achieve more USB capabilities with fewer gates.\n\n

A \"traditional\" approach includes four controllers, resulting in more gates to test and debug:\n\n

USB high speed host controller based on EHCI (a register interface)\n
Full/low speed host controller based on OHCI (another register interface)\n
USB device controller, supporting both high and full speeds\n
Fourth controller to switch the OTG root port between host and device controllers\n\n
Also, most gadgets must be either a host or a device. OTG hardware design merges all of the controllers into one dual-role controller that is somewhat more complex than an individual device controller.\n\n</item>
        <item>According to the USB (Universal Serial Bus) standard a device is classified as either a host or a peripheral device. In the most common scenarios the host, such as your PC, acts as a controller and the peripheral, such as a USB drive, responds to its commands. On-the-Go (OTG) is an extension to USB standard and is often referred to as USB OTG. The original host/peripheral model is maintained — however, what is new is the addition of a new class of devices that can function as either a host or peripheral and which are referred to as dual-role devices.\n\n

To enable an OTG connection an OTG cable is connected between two devices. An OTG cable typically has an OTG micro A-Type connector on one end, which connects to the host (e.g. Android device), and a standard USB connector on the other, which connects to the peripheral (e.g. RF Explorer device). When connected with an OTG cable, the initial host device is designated the A-Device (i.e. the Android device), with the initial peripheral designated the B-Device (i.e. the RF Explorer device).\n\n</item>

    <string-array name="microphone_descriptions">
        <item>A microphone, colloquially nicknamed mic or mike (/maɪk/), is a transducer that converts sound into an electrical signal.\n\n

Microphones are used in many applications such as telephones, hearing aids, public address systems for concert halls and public events, motion picture production, live and recorded audio engineering, sound recording, two-way radios, megaphones, radio and television broadcasting, and in computers for recording voice, speech recognition, VoIP, and for non-acoustic purposes such as ultrasonic sensors or knock sensors.\n\n

Several different types of microphone are in use, which employ different methods to convert the air pressure variations of a sound wave to an electrical signal. The most common are the dynamic microphone, which uses a coil of wire suspended in a magnetic field; the condenser microphone, which uses the vibrating diaphragm as a capacitor plate, and the piezoelectric microphone, which uses a crystal of piezoelectric material. Microphones typically need to be connected to a preamplifier before the signal can be recorded or reproduced.\n\n</item>
        <item>The sensitive transducer element of a microphone is called its element or capsule. Sound is first converted to mechanical motion by means of a diaphragm, the motion of which is then converted to an electrical signal.\n\n

            A complete microphone also includes a housing, some means of bringing the signal from the element to other equipment, and often an electronic circuit to adapt the output of the capsule to the equipment being driven. A wireless microphone contains a radio transmitter.\n\n</item>
        <item>These days, smartphones have more than one microphone for many operations.\n\n

Transmitting your voice over a digital network to the other person on the phone.\n
Capturing sound in audio and video recordings.\n
Taking voice as an input in dictation, voice commands, voice assistants, music recognition apps.\n\n</item>
        <item>Smartphone users are highly sensitive about privacy, not least because so much personal data is stored in just a few square centimeters. We shudder at the thought of what happened to Jennifer Lawrence and company, and that it may happen to us; someone spying on our most intimate data.\n\n

Yet that’s not all we should be wary of: There are some spy programs that can even remotely activate the microphone on your device and record you. One of the most infamous of these is StealthGenie, a spyware app that behaves like a Trojan and supports iOS, Android and Blackberry. It can geolocate the device, listen to conversations, capture messages and images and even activate the microphone, tracking all your actions throughout the day.\n\n

A company video claimed that the app had more than 100,000 satisfied customers, though it looks like the game is now up. Last October the company\’s CEO was arrested in the USA for promoting and selling this phone monitoring app..\n\n

It is paradoxical at least that this arrest should have occurred in the United States, where it has been revealed, thanks to Edward Snowden, that the government has been spying on the phones of so many users around the world. Such revelations from the CIA’s ex security analyst revealed that the NSA was using all types of systems to spy on smartphones, even using apps such as Angry Birds. And you thought killing a few pigs from your cell phone wouldn’t have any consequences!\n\n

A simple search will return a host of apps that promise to enable you to spy on your neighbor\’s phone. So next time you need to visit the bathroom, perhaps it\’s best not to take your phone with you.\n\n</item>

    <string-array name="nfc_descriptions">
        <item>Near-field communication (NFC) is a set of communication protocols that enable two electronic devices, one of which is usually a portable device such as a smartphone, to establish communication by bringing them within 4 cm (1.6 in) of each other.\n\n

NFC devices are used in contactless payment systems, similar to those used in credit cards and electronic ticket smartcards and allow mobile payment to replace/supplement these systems. This is sometimes referred to as NFC/CTLS (Contactless) or CTLS NFC. NFC is used for social networking, for sharing contacts, photos, videos or files. NFC-enabled devices can act as electronic identity documents and keycards. NFC offers a low-speed connection with simple setup that can be used to bootstrap more capable wireless connections.\n\n</item>
        <item>Similar ideas in advertising and industrial applications were not generally successful commercially, outpaced by technologies such as barcodes and UHF RFID tags. NFC protocols established a generally supported standard. When one of the connected devices has Internet connectivity, the other can exchange data with online services.\n\n

NFC-enabled portable devices can be provided with application software, for example to read electronic tags or make payments when connected to an NFC-compliant apparatus. Earlier close-range communication used technology that was proprietary to the manufacturer, for applications such as stock ticket, access control and payment readers.\n\n

Like other \"proximity card\" technologies, NFC employs electromagnetic induction between two loop antennas when NFC-enabled devices—for example a smartphone and a printer—exchange information, operating within the globally available unlicensed radio frequency ISM band of 13.56 MHz on ISO/IEC 18000-3 air interface at rates ranging from 106 to 424 kbit/s.\n\n

Each full NFC device can work in three modes:\n\n

NFC card emulation\n\n
Enables NFC-enabled devices such as smartphones to act like smart cards, allowing users to perform transactions such as payment or ticketing.\n\n
NFC reader/writer\n\n
Enables NFC-enabled devices to read information stored on inexpensive NFC tags embedded in labels or smart posters.\n\n
NFC peer-to-peer\n\n
Enables two NFC-enabled devices to communicate with each other to exchange information in an adhoc fashion.\n\n

NFC tags are passive data stores which can be read, and under some circumstances written to, by an NFC device. They typically contain data (as of 2015 between 96 and 8,192 bytes) and are read-only in normal use, but may be rewritable. Applications include secure personal data storage (e.g. debit or credit card information, loyalty program data, personal identification numbers (PINs), contacts). NFC tags can be custom-encoded by their manufacturers or use the industry specifications.\n\n</item>
        <item>NFC is a set of short-range wireless technologies, typically requiring a separation of 10 cm or less. NFC operates at 13.56 MHz on ISO/IEC 18000-3 air interface and at rates ranging from 106 kbit/s to 424 kbit/s. NFC always involves an initiator and a target; the initiator actively generates an RF field that can power a passive target. This enables NFC targets to take very simple form factors such as unpowered tags, stickers, key fobs, or cards. NFC peer-to-peer communication is possible, provided both devices are powered.\n\n

NFC tags contain data and are typically read-only, but may be writeable. They can be custom-encoded by their manufacturers or use NFC Forum specifications. The tags can securely store personal data such as debit and credit card information, loyalty program data, PINs and networking contacts, among other information. The NFC Forum defines four types of tags that provide different communication speeds and capabilities in terms of configurability, memory, security, data retention and write endurance. Tags currently offer between 96 and 4,096 bytes of memory.\n\n

As with proximity card technology, near-field communication uses electromagnetic induction between two loop antennas located within each other\'s near field, effectively forming an air-core transformer. It operates within the globally available and unlicensed radio frequency ISM band of 13.56 MHz. Most of the RF energy is concentrated in the allowed ±7 kHz bandwidth range, but the spectral mask for the main lobe is as wide as 1.8 MHz.\n\n

Theoretical working distance with compact standard antennas: up to 20 cm (practical working distance of about 10 cm). Note because the pickup antenna may be quenched by nearby metallic surfaces, the tags may need to be spaced slightly away from the surface.\n\n</item>
        <item>Although the range of NFC is limited to a few centimeters, plain NFC does not ensure secure communications. In 2006, Ernst Haselsteiner and Klemens Breitfuß described possible attacks and detailed how to leverage NFC\'s resistance to man-in-the-middle attacks to establish a specific key. As this technique is not part of the ISO standard, NFC offers no protection against eavesdropping and can be vulnerable to data modifications. Applications may use higher-layer cryptographic protocols (e.g. SSL) to establish a secure channel.\n\n

The RF signal for the wireless data transfer can be picked up with antennas. The distance from which an attacker is able to eavesdrop the RF signal depends on multiple parameters, but is typically less than 10 meters. Also, eavesdropping is highly affected by the communication mode. A passive device that doesn\'t generate its own RF field is much harder to eavesdrop on than an active device. An attacker can typically eavesdrop within 10 m and 1 m for active devices and passive devices, respectively.\n\n

Because NFC devices usually include ISO/IEC 14443 protocols, relay attacks are feasible. For this attack the adversary forwards the request of the reader to the victim and relays its answer to the reader in real time, pretending to be the owner of the victim\'s smart card. This is similar to a man-in-the-middle attack. One libnfc code example demonstrates a relay attack using two stock commercial NFC devices. This attack can be implemented using only two NFC-enabled mobile phones.\n\n</item>

    <string-array name="infrared_descriptions">
        <item>An infrared sensor is an electronic instrument that is used to sense certain characteristics of its surroundings. It does this by either emitting or detecting infrared radiation. Infrared sensors are also capable of measuring the heat being emitted by an object and detecting motion.\n\n

Infrared technology is found not just in industry, but also in every-day life. Televisions, for example, use an infrared detector to interpret the signals sent from a remote control. Passive Infrared sensors are used for motion detection systems, and LDR sensors are used for outdoor lighting systems. The key benefits of infrared sensors include their low power requirements, their simple circuitry and their portable features.\n\n</item>
        <item>Infrared waves are not visible to the human eye. In the electromagnetic spectrum, infrared radiation can be found between the visible and microwave regions. The infrared waves typically have wavelengths between 0.75 and 1000µm.\n\n

The infrared spectrum can be split into near IR, mid IR and far IR. The wavelength region from 0.75 to 3µm is known as the near infrared region. The region between 3 and 6µm is known as the mid-infrared region, and infrared radiation which has a wavelength greater higher than 6µm is known as far infrared.\n\n</item>
        <item>Infrared sensors can be active or passive and they can be split into two main types:\n\n

Thermal infrared sensors – use infrared energy as heat. Their photo sensitivity is independent of the wavelength being detected. Thermal detectors do not require cooling but do have slow response times and low detection capabilities. Read more about Thermal Infrared Sensors here.\n\n
Quantum infrared sensors – provide higher detection performance and faster response speed. Their photo sensitivity is dependent on wavelength. Quantum detectors have to be cooled in order to obtain accurate measurements.\n\n</item>
        <item>The physics behind infrared sensors is governed by three laws:\n\n

Planck\’s radiation law: Every object at a temperature T not equal to 0 K emits radiation\n\n

Stephan Boltzmann Law: The total energy emitted at all wavelengths by a black body is related to the absolute temperature\n\n

Wein\’s Displacement Law: Objects of different temperature emit spectra that peak at different wavelengths
All objects which have a temperature greater than absolute zero (0 Kelvin) posses thermal energy and are sources of infrared radiation as a result.\n\n

Sources of infrared radiation include blackbody radiators, tungsten lamps and silicon carbide. Infrared sensors typically use infrared lasers and LEDs with specific infrared wavelengths as sources.\n\n

        A transmission medium is required for infrared transmission, which can be comprised of either a vacuum, the atmosphere or an optical fiber.\n\n

Optical components such as optical lenses made from quartz, CaF2, Ge and Si, polyethylene Fresnel lenses and Al or Au mirrors are used to converge or focus the infrared radiation. In order to limit spectral response, band-pass filters can be used.\n\n

Next, infrared detectors are used to detect the radiation which has been focused. The output from the detector is usually very small and hence pre-amplifiers coupled with circuitry are required to further process the received signals.\n\n

        <item>History Of Android OS</item>

    <string-array name="android_os_descriptions">
        <item>An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.\n\n

Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources.\n\n

For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware, although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it. Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer – from cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers.\n\n

The dominant desktop operating system is Microsoft Windows with a market share of around 82.74%. macOS by Apple Inc. is in second place (13.23%), and the varieties of Linux are collectively in third place (1.57%). In the mobile (smartphone and tablet combined) sector, use in 2017 is up to 70% of Google\'s Android and according to third quarter 2016 data, Android on smartphones is dominant with 87.5 percent and a growth rate 10.3 percent per year, followed by Apple\'s iOS with 12.1 percent and a per year decrease in market share of 5.2 percent, while other operating systems amount to just 0.3 percent. Linux distributions are dominant in the server and supercomputing sectors. Other specialized classes of operating systems, such as embedded and real-time systems, exist for many applications.\n\n</item>
        <item>Single- and multi-tasking\n\n
A single-tasking system can only run one program at a time, while a multi-tasking operating system allows more than one program to be running in concurrency. This is achieved by time-sharing, where the available processor time is divided between multiple processes. These processes are each interrupted repeatedly in time slices by a task-scheduling subsystem of the operating system. Multi-tasking may be characterized in preemptive and co-operative types. In preemptive multitasking, the operating system slices the CPU time and dedicates a slot to each of the programs. Unix-like operating systems, such as Solaris and Linux—as well as non-Unix-like, such as AmigaOS—support preemptive multitasking. Cooperative multitasking is achieved by relying on each process to provide time to the other processes in a defined manner. 16-bit versions of Microsoft Windows used cooperative multi-tasking. 32-bit versions of both Windows NT and Win9x, used preemptive multi-tasking.\n\n

Single- and multi-user\n\n
Single-user operating systems have no facilities to distinguish users, but may allow multiple programs to run in tandem. A multi-user operating system extends the basic concept of multi-tasking with facilities that identify processes and resources, such as disk space, belonging to multiple users, and the system permits multiple users to interact with the system at the same time. Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources to multiple users.\n\n

Distributed\n\n
A distributed operating system manages a group of distinct computers and makes them appear to be a single computer. The development of networked computers that could be linked and communicate with each other gave rise to distributed computing. Distributed computations are carried out on more than one machine. When computers in a group work in cooperation, they form a distributed system.\n\n

Templated\n\n
In an OS, distributed and cloud computing context, templating refers to creating a single virtual machine image as a guest operating system, then saving it as a tool for multiple running virtual machines. The technique is used both in virtualization and cloud computing management, and is common in large server warehouses.\n\n

Embedded\n\n
Embedded operating systems are designed to be used in embedded computer systems. They are designed to operate on small machines like PDAs with less autonomy. They are able to operate with a limited number of resources. They are very compact and extremely efficient by design. Windows CE and Minix 3 are some examples of embedded operating systems.\n\n

Real-time\n\n
A real-time operating system is an operating system that guarantees to process events or data by a specific moment in time. A real-time operating system may be single- or multi-tasking, but when multitasking, it uses specialized scheduling algorithms so that a deterministic nature of behavior is achieved. An event-driven system switches between tasks based on their priorities or external events while time-sharing operating systems switch tasks based on clock interrupts.\n\n

Library
A library operating system is one in which the services that a typical operating system provides, such as networking, are provided in the form of libraries and composed with the application and configuration code to construct a unikernel: a specialized, single address space, machine image that can be deployed to cloud or embedded environments.\n\n

</item>
        <item>Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google, based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. In addition, Google has further developed Android TV for televisions, Android Auto for cars, and Wear OS for wrist watches, each with a specialized user interface. Variants of Android are also used on game consoles, digital cameras, PCs and other electronics.\n\n

Initially developed by Android Inc., which Google bought in 2005, Android was unveiled in 2007, with the first commercial Android device launched in September 2008. The operating system has since gone through multiple major releases, with the current version being 8.1 \"Oreo\", released in December 2017. The core Android source code is known as Android Open Source Project (AOSP), and is primarily licensed under the Apache License.\n\n</item>
        <item>Android Inc. was founded in Palo Alto, California, in October 2003 by Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears, and Chris White. Rubin described the Android project as \"tremendous potential in developing smarter mobile devices that are more aware of its owner\'s location and preferences\". The early intentions of the company were to develop an advanced operating system for digital cameras, and this was the basis of its pitch to investors in April 2004. The company then decided that the market for cameras was not large enough for its goals, and by five months later it had diverted its efforts and was pitching Android as a handset operating system that would rival Symbian and Microsoft Windows Mobile.

Rubin had difficulty attracting investors early on, and Android was facing eviction from its office space. Steve Perlman, a close friend of Rubin, brought him $10,000 in cash in an envelope, and shortly thereafter wired an undisclosed amount as seed funding. Perlman refused a stake in the company, and has stated \"I did it because I believed in the thing, and I wanted to help Andy.\"

In July 2005, Google acquired Android Inc. for at least $50 million. Its key employees, including Rubin, Miner and White, joined Google as part of the acquisition. Not much was known about the secretive Android at the time, with the company having provided few details other than that it was making software for mobile phones. At Google, the team led by Rubin developed a mobile device platform powered by the Linux kernel. Google marketed the platform to handset makers and carriers on the promise of providing a flexible, upgradeable system. Google had \"lined up a series of hardware components and software partners and signaled to carriers that it was open to various degrees of cooperation\".</item>

    </string-array>

    <string-array name="cpu_descriptions">
        <item>Today\’s smartphone and mobile processors are very powerful, so powerful that it is almost as powerful as a desktop computer.\n\n

            Processors are now coming up with more cores. Initially it was Single core, then came Dual core, we now have Quad core, Hexa core and even Octa core. Most processors are 64 bit now as against 32 bit when it started initially. The processing speed have reached up to 3.0 -3.5 GHz.\n\n

            The ability to include GPU (Graphic Processing Unit) inside mobile processors have enabled devices to churn out the best graphics picture, 3D capability, Virtual Reality capability and 4k recording. The improved processor technology also made today\’s modern mobile devices more power efficient.\n\n</item>
        <item>A mobile processor is found in mobile computers and cellphones.\n\n

A CPU chip is designed for portable computers, it is typically housed in a smaller chip package, but more importantly, in order to run cooler, it uses lower voltages than its desktop counterpart and has more sleep mode capability.\n\n

            A mobile processor can be throttled down to different power levels or sections of the chip can be turned off entirely when not in use. Further, the clock frequency may be stepped down under low processor loads. This stepping down conserves power and prolongs battery life.\n\n</item>
        <item>An embedded system is a computer system with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system, often with real-time computing constraints. It is embedded as part of a complete device often including hardware and mechanical parts. Embedded systems control many devices in common use today. Ninety-eight percent of all microprocessors are manufactured as components of embedded systems.\n\n

Examples of properties of typical embedded computers when compared with general-purpose counterparts are low power consumption, small size, rugged operating ranges, and low per-unit cost. This comes at the price of limited processing resources, which make them significantly more difficult to program and to interact with.\n\n

            However, by building intelligence mechanisms on top of the hardware, taking advantage of possible existing sensors and the existence of a network of embedded units, one can both optimally manage available resources at the unit and network levels as well as provide augmented functions, well beyond those available. For example, intelligent techniques can be designed to manage power consumption of embedded systems.\n\n

Modern embedded systems are often based on microcontrollers (i.e. CPUs with integrated memory or peripheral interfaces), but ordinary microprocessors (using external chips for memory and peripheral interface circuits) are also common, especially in more-complex systems. In either case, the processor(s) used may be types ranging from general purpose to those specialized in certain class of computations, or even custom designed for the application at hand. A common standard class of dedicated processors is the digital signal processor (DSP).\n\n</item>
        <item>One of the very first recognizably modern embedded systems was the Apollo Guidance Computer, developed ca. 1965 by Charles Stark Draper at the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory. At the project\'s inception, the Apollo guidance computer was considered the riskiest item in the Apollo project as it employed the then newly developed monolithic integrated circuits to reduce the size and weight. An early mass-produced embedded system was the Autonetics D-17 guidance computer for the Minuteman missile, released in 1961. When the Minuteman II went into production in 1966, the D-17 was replaced with a new computer that was the first high-volume use of integrated circuits.\n\n

Since these early applications in the 1960s, embedded systems have come down in price and there has been a dramatic rise in processing power and functionality. An early microprocessor for example, the Intel 4004, was designed for calculators and other small systems but still required external memory and support chips. In 1978 National Engineering Manufacturers Association released a \"standard\" for programmable microcontrollers, including almost any computer-based controllers, such as single board computers, numerical, and event-based controllers.\n\n

As the cost of microprocessors and microcontrollers fell it became feasible to replace expensive knob-based analog components such as potentiometers and variable capacitors with up/down buttons or knobs read out by a microprocessor even in consumer products. By the early 1980s, memory, input and output system components had been integrated into the same chip as the processor forming a microcontroller. Microcontrollers find applications where a general-purpose computer would be too costly.\n\n</item>
        <item>Nowadays, smartphones are so much more than phones and personal organizers. They\'re music and video players; they\'re mobile Web browsers; and they\'re cameras and camcorders. However, in order to do all those things, there needs to be a part of the system that can process and carry out those functions, which is where the processor enters the picture.\n\n

\"The processor is the brain of the smartphone,\" explains Nick Stam, director of technical marketing at Nvidia. \"Just like a regular desktop or laptop, these devices are, at the highest level, computers, and like computers, they have a processor to do all the basic calculations and to execute code.\"

Of course, with smartphones, you\'re dealing with a smaller form factor, so the design of the processor is somewhat different than what you\'d find on your computer. On your desktop, you\'ve got different elements, such as your central processor unit (CPU), graphics processing unit (GPU), memory, and peripheral buses, that all connect to the motherboard.\n\n

On a smartphone, you\'ve got similar components, as well as other sub-processors, but they\'re integrated onto a single chipset, referred to as System-on-a-Chip (SoC), since there isn\'t room to have different chipsets with the battery taking up so much space. So technically, when we talk about processors, we\'re really talking about the SoC, but for pretty obvious reasons.\n\n</item>

    <string-array name="radio_descriptions">
        <item>Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form.\n\n

Radio systems need a transmitter to modulate (change) some property of the energy produced to impress a signal on it, for example using amplitude modulation or angle modulation (which can be frequency modulation or phase modulation). Radio systems also need an antenna to convert electric currents into radio waves, and radio waves into an electric current.\n\n

            An antenna can be used for both transmitting and receiving. The electrical resonance of tuned circuits in radios allow individual frequencies to be selected. The electromagnetic wave is intercepted by a tuned receiving antenna. A radio receiver receives its input from an antenna and converts it into a form that is usable for the consumer, such as sound, pictures, digital data, measurement values, navigational positions, etc. Radio frequencies occupy the range from a 3 kHz to 300 GHz, although commercially important uses of radio use only a small part of this spectrum.\n\n

A radio communication system requires a transmitter and a receiver, each having an antenna and appropriate terminal equipment such as a microphone at the transmitter and a loudspeaker at the receiver in the case of a voice-communication system.\n\n</item>
        <item>A radio communication system sends signals by radio. Types of radio communication systems deployed depend on technology, standards, regulations, radio spectrum allocation, user requirements, service positioning, and investment.\n\n

The radio equipment involved in communication systems includes a transmitter and a receiver, each having an antenna and appropriate terminal equipment such as a microphone at the transmitter and a loudspeaker at the receiver in the case of a voice-communication system. The power consumed in a transmitting station varies depending on the distance of communication and the transmission conditions. The power received at the receiving station is usually only a tiny fraction of the transmitter\'s output, since communication depends on receiving the information, not the energy, that was transmitted.\n\n

Classical radio communications systems use frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) as a strategy to split up and share the available radio-frequency bandwidth for use by different parties\' communications concurrently. Modern radio communication systems include those that divide up a radio-frequency band by time-division multiplexing (TDM) and code-division multiplexing (CDM) as alternatives to the classical FDM strategy. These systems offer different tradeoffs in supporting multiple users, beyond the FDM strategy that was ideal for broadcast radio but less so for applications such as mobile telephony.\n\n

A radio communication system may send information only one way. For example, in broadcasting a single transmitter sends signals to many receivers. Two stations may take turns sending and receiving, using a single radio frequency; this is called \"simplex.\" By using two radio frequencies, two stations may continuously and concurrently send and receive signals - this is called \"duplex\" operation.\n\n</item>
        <item>Early uses were maritime, for sending telegraphic messages using Morse code between ships and land. The earliest users included the Japanese Navy scouting the Russian fleet during the Battle of Tsushima in 1905. One of the most memorable uses of marine telegraphy was during the sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912, including communications between operators on the sinking ship and nearby vessels, and communications to shore stations listing the survivors.\n\n

        Radio was used to pass on orders and communications between armies and navies on both sides in World War I; Germany used radio communications for diplomatic messages once it discovered that its submarine cables had been tapped by the British. The United States passed on President Woodrow Wilson\'s Fourteen Points to Germany via radio during the war.\n\n

        Broadcasting began from San Jose, California in 1909, and became feasible in the 1920s, with the widespread introduction of radio receivers, particularly in Europe and the United States. Besides broadcasting, point-to-point broadcasting, including telephone messages and relays of radio programs, became widespread in the 1920s and 1930s. Another use of radio in the pre-war years was the development of detection and locating of aircraft and ships by the use of radar (RAdio Detection And Ranging).\n\n

        Today, radio takes many forms, including wireless networks and mobile communications of all types, as well as radio broadcasting. Before the advent of television, commercial radio broadcasts included not only news and music, but dramas, comedies, variety shows, and many other forms of entertainment (the era from the late 1920s to the mid-1950s is commonly called radio\'s \"Golden Age\"). Radio was unique among methods of dramatic presentation in that it used only sound. For more, see radio programming.\n\n</item>
        <item>FM broadcast radio sends music and voice with less noise than AM radio. It is often mistakenly thought that FM is higher fidelity than AM, but that is not true. AM is capable of the same audio bandwidth that FM employs. AM receivers typically use narrower filters in the receiver to recover the signal with less noise.\n\n

            AM stereo receivers can reproduce the same audio bandwidth that FM does due to the wider filter used in an AM stereo receiver, but today, AM radios limit the audio bandpass to 3–5 kHz. In frequency modulation, amplitude variation at the microphone causes the transmitter frequency to fluctuate. Because the audio signal modulates the frequency and not the amplitude, an FM signal is not subject to static and interference in the same way as AM signals. Due to its need for a wider bandwidth, FM is transmitted in the Very High Frequency (VHF, 30 MHz to 300 MHz) radio spectrum.\n\n</item>

As of 2014, it has become the global standard for mobile communications – with over 90% market share, operating in over 193 countries and territories.\n

2G networks developed as a replacement for first generation (1G) analog cellular networks, and the GSM standard originally described as a digital, circuit-switched network optimized for full duplex voice telephony. This expanded over time to include data communications, first by circuit-switched transport, then by packet data transport via GPRS (General Packet Radio Services) and EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution, or EGPRS).\n\n

Subsequently, the 3GPP developed third-generation (3G) UMTS standards, followed by fourth-generation (4G) LTE Advanced standards, which do not form part of the ETSI GSM standard.\n\n

\"GSM\" is a trademark owned by the GSM Association. It may also refer to the (initially) most common voice codec used, Full Rate.\n\n</item>
        <item>The Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) is a third generation mobile cellular system for networks based on the GSM standard. Developed and maintained by the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project), UMTS is a component of the International Telecommunications Union IMT-2000 standard set and compares with the CDMA2000 standard set for networks based on the competing cdmaOne technology. UMTS uses wideband code division multiple access (W-CDMA) radio access technology to offer greater spectral efficiency and bandwidth to mobile network operators.\n\n

UMTS specifies a complete network system, which includes the radio access network (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network, or UTRAN), the core network (Mobile Application Part, or MAP) and the authentication of users via SIM (subscriber identity module) cards.\n\n

The technology described in UMTS is sometimes also referred to as Freedom of Mobile Multimedia Access (FOMA) or 3GSM.\n\n

Unlike EDGE (IMT Single-Carrier, based on GSM) and CDMA2000 (IMT Multi-Carrier), UMTS requires new base stations and new frequency allocations.\n\n</item>
        <item>UMTS supports maximum theoretical data transfer rates of 42 Mbit/s when Evolved HSPA (HSPA+) is implemented in the network.\n\n

            Users in deployed networks can expect a transfer rate of up to 384 kbit/s for Release \'99 (R99) handsets (the original UMTS release), and 7.2 Mbit/s for High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) handsets in the downlink connection. These speeds are significantly faster than the 9.6 kbit/s of a single GSM error-corrected circuit switched data channel, multiple 9.6 kbit/s channels in High-Speed Circuit-Switched Data (HSCSD) and 14.4 kbit/s for CDMAOne channels.\n\n

Since 2006, UMTS networks in many countries have been or are in the process of being upgraded with High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), sometimes known as 3.5G. Currently, HSDPA enables downlink transfer speeds of up to 21 Mbit/s.\n\n

            Work is also progressing on improving the uplink transfer speed with the High-Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA). Longer term, the 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) project plans to move UMTS to 4G speeds of 100 Mbit/s down and 50 Mbit/s up, using a next generation air interface technology based upon orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing.\n\n</item>
        <item>In 1983, work began to develop a European standard for digital cellular voice telecommunications when the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) set up the Groupe Spécial Mobile committee and later provided a permanent technical-support group based in Paris.\n\n

            Five years later, in 1987, 15 representatives from 13 European countries signed a memorandum of understanding in Copenhagen to develop and deploy a common cellular telephone system across Europe, and EU rules were passed to make GSM a mandatory standard. The decision to develop a continental standard eventually resulted in a unified, open, standard-based network which was larger than that in the United States.\n\n

In February 1987 Europe produced the very first agreed GSM Technical Specification. Ministers from the four big EU countries cemented their political support for GSM with the Bonn Declaration on Global Information Networks in May and the GSM MoU was tabled for signature in September. The MoU drew in mobile operators from across Europe to pledge to invest in new GSM networks to an ambitious common date.\n\n

In this short 38-week period the whole of Europe (countries and industries) had been brought behind GSM in a rare unity and speed guided by four public officials: Armin Silberhorn (Germany), Stephen Temple (UK), Philippe Dupuis (France), and Renzo Failli (Italy). In 1989 the Groupe Special Mobile committee was transferred from CEPT to the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).\n\n

In parallel France and Germany signed a joint development agreement in 1984 and were joined by Italy and the UK in 1986. In 1986, the European Commission proposed reserving the 900 MHz spectrum band for GSM. The former Finnish prime minister Harri Holkeri made the world\'s first GSM call on July 1, 1991, calling Kaarina Suonio (mayor of the city of Tampere) using a network built by Telenokia and Siemens and operated by Radiolinja. The following year saw the sending of the first short messaging service (SMS or \"text message\") message, and Vodafone UK and Telecom Finland signed the first international roaming agreement.\n\n</item>

    <string-array name="motion_detector_descriptions">
        <item>A motion detector is a device that detects moving objects, particularly people. Such a device is often integrated as a component of a system that automatically performs a task or alerts a user of motion in an area.\n\n

            They form a vital component of security, automated lighting control, home control, energy efficiency, and other useful systems.\n\n</item>
        <item>An electronic motion detector contains an optical, microwave, or acoustic sensor, and in many cases a transmitter for illumination. However, a passive sensor senses a signature only from the moving object via emission or reflection, i.e., it can be emitted by the object, or by some ambient emitter such as the sun or a radio station of sufficient strength.\n\n

            Changes in the optical, microwave, or acoustic field in the device\'s proximity are interpreted by the electronics based on one of the technologies listed below. Most low-cost motion detectors can detect up to distances of at least 15 feet (4.6 m). Specialized systems cost more, but have much longer ranges. Tomographic motion detection systems can cover much larger areas because the radio waves are at frequencies which penetrate most walls and obstructions, and are detected in multiple locations, not only at the location of the transmitter.\n\n

Motion detectors have found wide use in domestic and commercial applications. One common application is activating automatic door openers in businesses and public buildings. Motion sensors are also widely used in lieu of a true occupancy sensor in activating street lights or indoor lights in walkways, such as lobbies and staircases.\n\n

            In such smart lighting systems, energy is conserved by only powering the lights for the duration of a timer, after which the person has presumably left the area. A motion detector may be among the sensors of a burglar alarm that is used to alert the home owner or security service when it detects the motion of a possible intruder. Such a detector may also trigger a security camera to record the possible intrusion.\n\n</item>
        <item>Passive infrared (PIR)\n\n
Passive infrared (PIR) sensors are sensitive to a person\'s skin temperature through emitted black body radiation at mid-infrared wavelengths, in contrast to background objects at room temperature. No energy is emitted from the sensor, thus the name passive infrared. This distinguishes it from the electric eye for instance (not usually considered a motion detector), in which the crossing of a person or vehicle interrupts a visible or infrared beam.\n\n
Microwave\n\n
These detect motion through the principle of Doppler radar, and are similar to a radar speed gun. A continuous wave of microwave radiation is emitted, and phase shifts in the reflected microwaves due to motion of an object toward (or away from) the receiver result in a heterodyne signal at a low audio frequency.\n\n
Ultrasonic\n\n
An ultrasonic transducer emits an ultrasonic wave (sound at a frequency higher than a human ear can hear) and receivers reflections from nearby objects. Exactly as in Doppler radar, heterodyne detection of the received field indicates motion. The detected doppler shift is also at low audio frequencies (for walking speeds) since the ultrasonic wavelength of around a centimeter is similar to the wavelengths used in microwave motion detectors. One potential drawback of ultrasonic sensors is that the sensor can be sensitive to motion in areas where coverage is undesired, for instance, due to reflections of sound waves around corners. Such extended coverage may be desirable for lighting control, where the goal is detection of any occupancy in an area. But for opening an automatic door, for example, a sensor selective to traffic in the path toward the door is superior.\n\n
Tomographic motion detector\n\n
These systems sense disturbances to radio waves as they pass from node to node of a mesh network. They have the ability to detect over large areas completely because they can sense through walls and other obstructions.\n\n
Video camera software\n\n
With the proliferation of low-cost digital cameras able to shoot video, it is possible to use the output of such a camera to detect motion in its field of view using software. This solution is particularly attractive when the intent is to record video triggered by motion detection, as no hardware beyond the camera and computer is needed. Since the observed field may be normally illuminated, this may be considered another passive technology. However it can also be used together with near-infrared illumination to detect motion in the dark, that is, with the illumination at a wavelength undetectable by a human eye.\n\n
Gesture detector\n\n
Photodetectors and infrared lighting elements can support digital screens to detect hand motions and gestures with the aid of machine learning algorithms.\n\n</item>
        <item>Motion sensors aren\'t just used for home security. In industrial fields, they are used on assembly lines to keep track of the number of products and to shut down dangerous equipment if a person gets too close.\n\n

Here are a few other ways motion sensors are used:\n\n

To open and close automatic Doors\n
To turn on and off automatic water faucets and toilets\n
To turn on lights when a person enters a room\n
To control ATM displays\n
At automatic ticket gates\n
For some parking meters\n\n
Motion sensors aren\'t just an additional feature of a security system—they are essential. Without sensors, there wouldn\'t be a way to detect intruders.</item>

    <string-array name="storage_descriptions">
        <item>Secure Digital (SD) is a non-volatile memory card format developed by the SD Card Association (SDA) for use in portable devices.\n\n

The standard was introduced in August 1999 by joint efforts between SanDisk, Panasonic (Matsushita Electric) and Toshiba as an improvement over MultiMediaCards (MMC), and has become the industry standard. The three companies formed SD-3C, LLC, a company that licenses and enforces intellectual property rights associated with SD memory cards and SD host and ancillary products.\n\n

The companies also formed the SD Association (SDA), a non-profit organization, in January 2000 to promote and create SD Card standards. SDA today has about 1,000 member companies. The SDA uses several trademarked logos owned and licensed by SD-3C to enforce compliance with its specifications and assure users of compatibility.\n\n

        Secure Digital includes five card families available in three different sizes. The five families are the original Standard-Capacity (SDSC), the High-Capacity (SDHC), the eXtended-Capacity (SDXC), the Ultra-Capacity (SDUC) and the SDIO, which combines input/output functions with data storage. The three form factors are the original size, the mini size, and the micro size. Electrically passive adapters allow a smaller card to fit and function in a device built for a larger card. The SD card\'s small footprint is an ideal storage medium for smaller, thinner and more portable electronic devices.\n\n</item>
        <item>SD card speed is customarily rated by its sequential read or write speed. The sequential performance aspect is the most relevant for storing and retrieving large files (relative to block sizes internal to the flash memory), such as images and multimedia. Small data (such as file names, sizes and timestamps) falls under the much lower speed limit of random access, which can be the limiting factor in some use cases.\n\n

With early SD cards, a few card manufacturers specified the speed as a \"times\" (\"×\") rating, which compared the average speed of reading data to that of the original CD-ROM drive. This was superseded by the Speed Class Rating, which guarantees a minimum rate at which data can be written to the card.\n\n

The newer families of SD card improve card speed by increasing the bus rate (the frequency of the clock signal that strobes information into and out of the card). Whatever the bus rate, the card can signal to the host that it is \"busy\" until a read or a write operation is complete. Compliance with a higher speed rating is a guarantee that the card limits its use of the \"busy\" indication.\n\n</item>
        <item>Internal Storage, also being called System Memory, is used to store the operation system, system apps, and other app data (messages, contacts, email settings, and other personal information). This part of storage is unaccessible to users. To better understand the internal storage, let\'s connect a 32GB Samsung S7 Edge to the computer, we can see there are only 23.9 GB of storage accessible. The remaining 8.1 GB belong to Internal Storage for operating system and sensitive data.\n\n

        When most of the Internal Storage are used, a system file on Internal Storage will trigger a low storage message, reminding us to delete files, even there are much space left in phone storage. That\'s why we find it strange to get the insufficient storage notification with enough space left.\n\n</item>
        <item>Phone Storage is the space that can actually accessed and used by the users. When we navigate to \"Settings\" > \"Storage\" and open \"Used space\", we can see the files that are stored on Phone Storage, including downloaded apps, pictures, videos, audio, etc. In fact, Phone Storage is the default location for installed apps, games, camera photos, downloaded music and media files. When the phone is connected to PC, this part of storage area behaves much like a SD card, on which you can add or delete files.\n\n</item>
        <item>External storage generally means removable microSD card that is inserted into the phone to add extra space to the phone. But not all Android models come with SD card slot, for example, most of the Nexus models don\'t support external storage. That\'s simply because cheap SD card usually affects the device\'s performance and make it sluggish. External storage can be used to save media files such as pictures, music, videos while most applications can not be installed on external storage.\n\n

If your mobile phone is OTG supported, you can also use USB driver for external storage.\n\n

Tip: If you accidentally delete media files on SD card, you can restore the lost files from SD card with Android Data Recovery\n\n</item>

        <item>Random-access memory (RAM /ræm/) is a form of computer data storage that stores data and machine code currently being used. A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory. In contrast, with other direct-access data storage media such as hard disks, CD-RWs, DVD-RWs and the older magnetic tapes and drum memory, the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement.\n\n

RAM contains multiplexing and de-multiplexing circuitry, to connect the data lines to the addressed storage for reading or writing the entry. Usually more than one bit of storage is accessed by the same address, and RAM devices often have multiple data lines and are said to be \"8-bit\" or \"16-bit\", etc. devices.\n\n

In today\'s technology, random-access memory takes the form of integrated circuits. RAM is normally associated with volatile types of memory (such as DRAM modules), where stored information is lost if power is removed, although non-volatile RAM has also been developed. Other types of non-volatile memories exist that allow random access for read operations, but either do not allow write operations or have other kinds of limitations on them. These include most types of ROM and a type of flash memory called NOR-Flash.</item>
        <item>Early computers used relays, mechanical counters or delay lines for main memory functions. Ultrasonic delay lines could only reproduce data in the order it was written. Drum memory could be expanded at relatively low cost but efficient retrieval of memory items required knowledge of the physical layout of the drum to optimize speed. Latches built out of vacuum tube triodes, and later, out of discrete transistors, were used for smaller and faster memories such as registers. Such registers were relatively large and too costly to use for large amounts of data; generally only a few dozen or few hundred bits of such memory could be provided.\n\n

The first practical form of random-access memory was the Williams tube starting in 1947. It stored data as electrically charged spots on the face of a cathode ray tube. Since the electron beam of the CRT could read and write the spots on the tube in any order, memory was random access. The capacity of the Williams tube was a few hundred to around a thousand bits, but it was much smaller, faster, and more power-efficient than using individual vacuum tube latches. Developed at the University of Manchester in England, the Williams tube provided the medium on which the first electronically stored program was implemented in the Manchester Baby computer, which first successfully ran a program on 21 June 1948. In fact, rather than the Williams tube memory being designed for the Baby, the Baby was a testbed to demonstrate the reliability of the memory.\n\n

Magnetic-core memory was invented in 1947 and developed up until the mid-1970s. It became a widespread form of random-access memory, relying on an array of magnetized rings. By changing the sense of each ring\'s magnetization, data could be stored with one bit stored per ring. Since every ring had a combination of address wires to select and read or write it, access to any memory location in any sequence was possible.</item>
        <item>Today\’s phones\’ general storage is random access too, because it\’s comprised of eMMC chips rather than little spinning disc platters, but the most important distinction remains. A phone\’s RAM is going to be much, much faster than the 8GB-64GB storage you use to store apps and music.\n\n

            RAM is used to hold the data a phone, or any computer system, is currently using. That way the speed of the storage doesn\’t become a bottleneck that slows the whole system down.

In the context of a phone, this means a chunk of an app\’s data is loaded into RAM as soon as the app is started. Data is then shifted from RAM into a relatively tiny but even faster chunk of memory, the CPU caches, as it\’s dealt with.

If the CPU is a chef, the cache is their chopping board, RAM the kitchen cupboards, and general storage the supermarket 15 minutes down the road. That gives you an idea of how impossibly slow a phone would be if it really only used the kind of \‘memory\’ we install apps onto.\n\n

            Just as important, RAM is also what holds the data that enables multi-tasking. Some mobile devices now offer real Windows-style multi-tasking, where two apps are running on-screen at once.  A good amount of RAM is crucial for this.\n\n


The iPad mini 4 has 2GB RAM, and can perform real multi-tasking thanks to iOS 9. The iPad mini 3 with 1GB RAM cannot. This doesn\’t mean it would be impossible, of course, but that Apple thinks multi-tasking doesn\’t run well enough on a 1GB RAM device.\n\n

This isn\’t the most important kind of mobile multi-tasking, though. RAM is also what lets you flick between apps without having to start from scratch each time. Even if an app isn\’t actively doing anything in the background, RAM is used to create a saved state that the phone can zap back into as if you\’d never left.\n\n

We take all this for granted, but have RAM to thank.\n\n
        </item>
        <item>This is the crux of why having more RAM is better. It lets a phone store more of these app snapshots without encroaching on the RAM a phone needs to make its OS run effectively.\n\n

Android and iOS do not run like Windows, though. With a desktop operating system it\’s still possible to open far too many apps, to the point that the computer collapses into a juddering heap. I do this all the time, ending up annoyed at my laptop before realising it\’s only running poorly because I have 70 browser instances open and 100 3MB images loaded on Photoshop. It\’s my fault.\n\n


You can\’t really misuse mobile operating systems in the same way because memory management happens automatically, and is more aggressive. Where with Windows yo’d have to start closing apps when you stretch your RAM, iOS and Android simply offload app data from system RAM like a digital PA. Some apps may then still retain some of their \‘state\’ data on the solid state storage, but at this point the app will have to reload fully when you return.\n\n

This is why a phone with barely enough RAM to keep its system running properly is going to be crap at multi-tasking. Leave at app, return 30 seconds later and you\’ll have to wait just as long as you did when you first booted it up.\n\n
